## CSS Filter Property

CSS3 provides a VERY versatile property for manipulating the graphical styling of elements.

The `filter: ` property receives one or more functions as its value that which, when applied, affect how elements including images are ultimately rendered on screen.

Some of the functions that can be applied via the filter property include:

- blur()
- hue-rotate()
- saturate()
- brightness()
- contrast()
- grayscale()
- sepia()

For additional examples and functions, see MDN Web docs: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter#try_it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter#try_it)

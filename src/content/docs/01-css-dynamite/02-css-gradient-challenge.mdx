## ðŸŒƒ Practice Exercise: CSS Nightscape Scene (15 Min)

This practice is **not graded** but is essential for mastering multi-stop linear gradients.

See how far you can get in 15 minutes (but feel free to continue at home).

### The Goal: Create a Night Scene

You previously saw how to combine and stop colors to create a warm, vibrant sunset. Your task is to apply those same techniques to create a **cool, deep blue night sky** with a soft, glowing **moon** or **aurora effect**.

### The Setup

We'll use a single container element in HTML for this exercise:

```html
<div class="night-scene"></div>
```

### 1\. Build the Gradients (10 Minutes)

Using the `.night-scene` class, define at least **two separate gradients** on the `background` property to simulate depth and color variation:

- **Linear Gradient (Sky Color):** Create a linear gradient using deep, dark, cool colors. Start with a very dark indigo or black at the top and transition to a slightly lighter navy blue at the bottom.
  - _Hint:_ Use color stops (e.g., `50%`, `90%`) to control the sharpness of the transition.
- **Radial Gradient (Moon Glow):** Overlay a radial gradient to simulate a soft moon glow or a subtle nebula. Use a transparent or very light blue/white color in the center, quickly fading out to transparent.
  - _Hint:_ You can use the `at <position>` syntax to place the moon in the corner (e.g., `radial-gradient(...) at 10% 10%`).

```css
/* Your CSS goes here */
.night-scene {
  height: 400px;
  width: 100%;
  background: 
    /* [Add your Radial Gradient here for the moon/glow effect] */ ,
    /* [Add your Linear Gradient here for the night sky] */;
}
```

### 2\. Challenge / Debugging (5 Minutes)

- **Overlay:** Ensure your `radial-gradient` is listed **first** so it sits on top of your `linear-gradient` sky layer.
- **Opacity:** Experiment with semi-transparent colors (using `rgba()`) in your radial gradient to make the glow soft and atmospheric. We'll be covering rgba() in more detail in a moment...

### 3\. Extra Challenges

- Add some stars
- Add some planets too!

### 4\. AI Exploration

- Prompt the AI of your choice to generate the nightscape
- Compare with your own code
- Work with AI to refine the result

- **Lots of AI powered exploration and learning to be had!!**

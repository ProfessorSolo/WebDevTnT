# 🧾 Familial Selectors  
*The combinator spellbook*

In **Familial Sorcery**, we visited the *Hall of Stories* and watched selectors quietly shape the layout based on family relationships.

Now we open the spellbook and name the four main combinators:

- **Descendant** — `A B`  
- **Direct child** — `A > B`  
- **Adjacent sibling** — `A + B`  
- **General sibling** — `A ~ B`  

Our goal here is simple:

> See how **different selector spells** can target the **same elements**,  
> and talk about the trade-offs of each choice.

We’ll keep using the same markup from the Hall of Stories:

```html
<section class="hall-of-stories">
  <h2 class="hall-title">Hall of Stories</h2>

  <article class="story">
    <h3 class="story-title">On the Nature of Siblings</h3>
    <p class="story-meta">Arcane CSS · 3 min read</p>
    <p>Some elements follow quietly. Others insist on standing right next to you.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="story">
    <h3 class="story-title">Children of the Root</h3>
    <p class="story-meta">DOM Lore · 2 min read</p>
    <p>Descendants whisper stories about the containers they live in.</p>
  </article>

  <p class="hall-note">Further tales are still being inscribed…</p>
</section>
```

## 1️⃣ Target: Every Story Card in the Hall

We want to style all story cards inside the hall.

```css
/* Option A — class + descendant */
.hall-of-stories .story {
  /* styles */
}

/* Option B — more explicit structure */
section.hall-of-stories article.story {
  /* styles */
}

/* Option C — looser: any .story anywhere */
.story {
  /* styles */
}
```

- **Option A** is usually the sweet spot: clear and scoped to this hall.  
- **Option B** is more specific and tied to element types.  
- **Option C** might be fine in a very small project, but in a larger spellbook it risks hitting stories in places we didn’t intend.

## 2️⃣ Target: Title as a Direct Child

We want to style the `.story-title` that sits directly inside `.story`.

```css
/* Option A — descendant */
.story .story-title {
  /* styles */
}

/* Option B — direct child */
.story > .story-title {
  /* styles */
}

/* Option C — type + class + child */
article.story > h3.story-title {
  /* styles */
}
```

**Reading the spells out loud:**

- A: “Any `.story-title` inside a `.story`.”  
- B: “Any `.story-title` that is a direct child of `.story`.”  
- C: “Any `h3` with class `.story-title` that is a direct child of an `article.story`.”

All are valid incantations. B and C are stronger about the **shape** of the markup.

---

## 3️⃣ Target: The Meta Line Right After the Title

We want to style the `.story-meta` that comes immediately after `.story-title`.

```css
/* Option A — adjacent sibling, class-based */
.story-title + .story-meta {
  /* styles */
}

/* Option B — adjacent sibling, type-based */
h3.story-title + p.story-meta {
  /* styles */
}

/* Option C — descendant + adjacent combo */
.story .story-title + .story-meta {
  /* styles */
}
```

Here the `+` combinator is doing the work:

> “Any `.story-meta` that is the **next sibling** right after `.story-title`.”

Option A is usually enough.  
Options B and C add a bit more context and specificity.

---

## 4️⃣ Target: Everything After the Hall Title

We want to give a subtle top border to everything that comes after the main heading.

```css
/* Option A — general siblings of the title */
.hall-title ~ * {
  /* styles */
}

/* Option B — scoped to the hall explicitly */
.hall-of-stories .hall-title ~ * {
  /* styles */
}

/* Option C — name specific families if we ever need more control */
.hall-title ~ .story,
.hall-title ~ .hall-note {
  /* styles */
}
```

The `~` combinator reads as:

> “Any element that is a **sibling after** `.hall-title` (sharing the same parent).”

Option A is compact and expressive.  
Option C gains precision at the cost of some duplication.

## 🧠 What We Learn from Familial Spells

- The same element can often be reached by **several different selectors**.  
- Our job is to choose the incantation that best balances:
  - readability  
  - resilience to small HTML changes  
  - and the level of scoping we actually need  

When we read selectors like sentences, our spellbook becomes easier to maintain:

- “Every story inside the hall.”  
- “The title that is a direct child of story.”  
- “The meta line immediately after the title.”  
- “Everything that comes after the main heading.”

Next school: **Relational Runes**, where we start counting the children instead of just naming who they’re related to.

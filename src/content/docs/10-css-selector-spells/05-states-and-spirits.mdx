# ⚡ States & Spirits

_How elements respond, react, and reveal state_

So far our spells have been about **structure** and **position**.  
In **States & Spirits**, we listen for the UI’s heartbeat:

> **“What happens when someone hovers, clicks, tabs, or types?”**

Here we care about pseudo-classes like:

- `:hover`, `:active`
- `:focus`, `:focus-visible`
- `:checked`
- `:valid`, `:invalid`

Before we start naming them in isolation, we’ll watch them all dance together.

## ✨ MiniMo — Reader Preferences Panel

This minimo shows a tiny “Reader Preferences” panel:  
a layout mode toggle, a breaking-news checkbox, and an email field for alerts.

Every glow, border, and pill is wired to **state selectors**.

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/css-selector-spells/m10-states-reader-preferences.html"
  title="States & Spirits — Reader Preferences"
  height="640px"
/>

As we interact with it, notice:

- Buttons react to **hover**, **active**, and **focus-visible**.
- The breaking-news row lights up only when the checkbox is **checked**.
- The email field glows **lime** when it looks valid, and **rose** when it looks invalid.
- A tiny “STATE” pill sits on the right of the email and flips its color with the field’s validity.

Those colors are not arbitrary—they’re visual runes for different categories of state.

## 🧩 Quest Notes — Listening to the UI Spirits

We keep the CSS hidden for now.  
Our job is to observe, poke at the UI, and guess which pseudo-classes might be driving each effect.

Color legend for this minimo:

- 🟦 **Hover/Active spirit** — neon cyan / orange glows on buttons
- 🟪 **Focus spirit** — violet rings around focused controls
- 🟧 **Checked spirit** — orange aura around the breaking-news row
- 🟩 **Valid spirit** — lime glow on a good email
- 🟥 **Invalid spirit** — rose glow on a bad email

### 🟦 Quest I — The Fidgety Buttons

Try moving the pointer over each layout mode button, then pressing them, then tabbing to them with the keyboard.

- Which effects seem tied to **pointer hover** only?
- Which effects show up only when the button is **keyboard focused**?
- Which effects flash when the button is **actively pressed**?

Which combination of `:hover`, `:active`, and `:focus-visible` would most likely produce this behavior?

---

### 🟧 Quest II — The Breaking-Only Aura

Look closely at the “Breaking news only” pill.

- How does it look when the checkbox is checked vs unchecked?
- Does the **label** itself respond, or only the tiny checkbox square?

Which selector could let the parent label react when its child input is `:checked`—  
without adding an extra class from JavaScript?

---

### 🟩🟥 Quest III — The Email Mood Ring

Play with the email input:

1. Leave it empty.
2. Type a clearly invalid value (`hello` or `@` or `test`).
3. Type a clean address like `student@example.com`.

Watch the border and glow colors:

- When does it feel **neutral**?
- When does the field clearly look **unhappy**?
- When does it look **confident and valid**?

Which combination of `:valid`, `:invalid`, and `:placeholder-shown` would let us:

- avoid punishing an untouched empty field,
- show rose only when there’s real text that doesn’t parse,
- and show lime only when the browser thinks the email is valid?

---

### 🟪 Quest IV — Focus Without Harassment

Use the **Tab** key to move through the controls.

- Which elements show a strong **focus ring**?
- Does that ring appear when we click with the mouse, or only via keyboard?

Why might we reach for `:focus-visible` instead of plain `:focus` here?

When Tinkerbell hums the dial tone like this:  
`* • * • * • *`

…we turn to **06 — State Selectors** and unmask the exact runes behind each glow: the selectors that wire hover, focus, checked, and validity into this tiny panel.

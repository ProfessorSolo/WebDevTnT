# 🧷 Selectagonal-Ally

_The chamber of many edges_

We’ve walked the whole Academy of CSS Selectors:

- traced **family trees** of elements,
- counted their place among **siblings**,
- listened to the **spirits of state**,
- read the **runes in attributes**,
- and finally, bent the rules with the **Unconditional Arts**.

This last chamber pulls those edges together into a single, many-sided form:  
a **selectagonal** way of thinking — where every selector is just another facet  
on the same crystal.

## 🌌 Your Module at a Glance

By the end of **CSS Selector Spells**, we should be able to:

- Describe how the browser walks the DOM using **combinators** and **hierarchy**
- Choose between **class, type, ID, attribute, and pseudo-class** selectors
- Use **structural selectors** to target “nth of its kind” without extra markup
- React to **state changes** (`:hover`, `:focus`, `:checked`, `:valid`, etc.)
- Let **attributes and data-attributes** drive style instead of more classes
- Compose logic with `:is()`, `:not()`, `:has()`, and `:where()`
- Read a complex selector and rewrite it in plainer English (or the reverse)

In plain terms: we’re no longer guessing which selector “might work.”  
We’re choosing intentionally from a spellbook.

## 🏛 The Five Schools, Side by Side

### 1️⃣ Familial Sorcery — **Structure & Ancestry**

- Type, class, and ID selectors
- Descendant vs direct child (`A B` vs `A > B`)
- Sibling relationships (`A + B` and `A ~ B`)

We use these when **who is inside whom** (and in what order) is the main story.

---

### 2️⃣ Relational Runes — **Position Among Siblings**

- `:first-child`, `:last-child`, `:nth-child()`
- `:first-of-type`, `:nth-of-type()`
- Patterns like `2n`, `2n+1`, `4n+1`, etc.

We use these when we care about **which** sibling,  
not just that it exists.

---

### 3️⃣ States & Spirits — **Moods & Moments**

- `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`
- `:checked`, `:disabled`, `:required`
- `:valid`, `:invalid`, `:in-range`, etc.

We use these when styling depends on **current interaction**  
or **validation state** rather than static structure.

---

### 4️⃣ Arcane Attributes — **The Inscriptions**

- Exact match: `[attr="value"]`
- Token list: `[attr~=token]`
- Prefix: `[attr^="prefix"]`
- Suffix: `[attr$="suffix"]`
- Contains: `[attr*="fragment"]`

We use these when the **data model** already contains the answer,  
and we’d rather not bolt on yet another utility class.

---

### 5️⃣ Unconditional Arts — **Logic & Awareness**

- `:is()` — group multiple patterns into one tail
- `:not()` — clearly define exceptions
- `:has()` — let parents react to children
- `:where()` — soft, low-specificity defaults

We use these when ordinary selectors start to feel like  
they’re missing one last piece of logic.

## 🧪 What You’ve Practised

Across the MiniMos in this module, we’ve:

- Highlighted **direct vs descendant** elements in nested story lists
- Used **nth-child / nth-of-type** to build repeatable, patterned layouts
- Reacted to **hover, focus, valid, and checked** to change styling without JS
- Let **`data-*` attributes** control color, badges, and iconography
- Used `:is()`, `:not()`, and `:has()` to change styling based on rank, state, and inner sigils
- Kept resets and spacing sane with **`:where()`** instead of stacking specificity

Individually each MiniMo is tiny.  
Together they form a **selector vocabulary** you can reuse in any project.

## 🧮 Selector Sigil Cheat Sheet

A small circle of spells to keep in view:

```css
/* Families & siblings */
.card-grid > .card                 /* direct children only */
.article + .article                /* the very next sibling */
.article ~ .article                /* all following siblings */

/* Structural runes */
.list-item:first-of-type           /* first of its kind */
.list-item:nth-of-type(2n + 1)     /* every odd item of its type */

/* Spirits of state */
input:focus-visible                /* keyboard-focused only */
input:valid                        /* passes validation */
input:checked + label              /* style label of a checked control */

/* Attribute runes */
button[data-variant="primary"]     /* exact match */
[data-tags~="featured"]            /* token in space-separated list */
[href^="https://"]                 /* starts with */
[src$=".svg"]                      /* ends with */
[data-role*="admin"]               /* contains substring */

/* Unconditional arts */
.card:is(.featured, .pinned)       /* shared styling for either */
button:not(.primary)               /* everything that isn’t primary */
.card:has(.badge--alert)           /* card reacts to child badge */
.form :where(h2, p, ul)            /* soft defaults, easy to override */
```

You don’t need all of these in every layout.  
But knowing they exist keeps your options open.

## 🎯 How to Keep Practising

A few quick drills to stay sharp:

- **Selector translation**

  - Take any complex selector from a codebase or article.
  - Write one sentence in plain English describing _exactly_ what it matches.
  - Then do the reverse: write the English first, then try to express it in CSS.

- **One layout, many spells**

  - Pick a small component (card grid, form, nav, gallery).
  - Try to style the same target using **three different selector strategies**:
    - classes only,
    - attributes + structural selectors,
    - with and without `:is()` / `:not()`.

- **DOM-first thinking**
  - Sketch a tiny HTML structure.
  - Before writing any CSS, list **which selectors** you’d reach for and why.

## 🤖 Optional: AI-Assisted Practice Prompt

When you want extra sparring practice, you can paste something like this into T.A. Watts or another assistant:

> “I’m practising CSS selectors.  
> Give me 5 small HTML snippets and, for each one,  
> 2–3 challenges like: ‘write a selector that targets X but not Y’.  
> Vary the difficulty and include answers after I guess.”

Let the assistant be the mischievous examiner;  
we stay the patient spellcaster.

## 🔥 Forge Ahead

We’ve bent structure, commanded siblings, whispered to states,  
read the ancient runes of attributes, and woven pure logic into the DOM.  
The Selectagon hums at our fingertips — every edge awakened.

Now we step beyond selector spellcraft  
and into the **Function Forge**,  
where values melt, units collide,  
and `calc()`, `clamp()`, and `var()`  
strike sparks against the anvil of layout itself.

Sharpen your quill, apprentice.  
The real alchemy begins.

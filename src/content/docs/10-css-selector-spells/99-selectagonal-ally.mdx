# 🧷 Selectagonal-Ally

_The chamber of many edges_

We’ve walked the whole Academy of CSS Selectors:

- traced **family trees** of elements,
- counted their place among **siblings**,
- listened to the **spirits of state**,
- read the **runes in attributes**,
- and finally, bent the rules with the **Unconditional Arts**.

This last chamber pulls those edges together into a single, many-sided form:  
a **selectagonal** way of thinking — where every selector is just another facet  
on the same crystal.

## 🌌 Your Module at a Glance

By the end of **CSS Selector Spells**, we should be able to:

- Describe how the browser walks the DOM using **combinators** and **hierarchy**
- Choose between **class, type, ID, attribute, and pseudo-class** selectors
- Use **structural selectors** to target “nth of its kind” without extra markup
- React to **state changes** (`:hover`, `:focus`, `:checked`, `:valid`, etc.)
- Let **attributes and data-attributes** drive style instead of more classes
- Compose logic with `:is()`, `:not()`, `:has()`, and `:where()`
- Read a complex selector and rewrite it in plainer English (or the reverse)

In plain terms: we’re no longer guessing which selector “might work.”  
We’re choosing intentionally from a spellbook.

## 🧪 Selector Spells Demo Lab — Full Repository

The complete hands-on “Selector Spells” workshop lives in the Demo Lab repo below.  
Every MiniMo, every sigil, every selector experiment used in this module comes from here.

# Clone locally to explore the full spell-lab

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProfessorSolo/WebDevTnT-CSS-Selector-Spells.git

Use this lab to revisit each selector school in isolation, then combine them as you grow into the Selectagon.

Start with the video, apprentice.

It’s the quickest path to enlightenment.

Watch each selector school in action — families, siblings, spirits, inscriptions, and the Unconditional Arts.

Once you’ve seen the spells cast live, the MiniMos and Demo Lab become _your_ playground instead of a maze of glyphs.

## 🏛 The Five Schools, Side by Side

### 1️⃣ Familial Sorcery — **Structure & Ancestry**

- Type, class, and ID selectors
- Descendant vs direct child (`A B` vs `A > B`)
- Sibling relationships (`A + B` and `A ~ B`)

We use these when **who is inside whom** (and in what order) is the main story.

---

### 2️⃣ Relational Runes — **Position Among Siblings**

- `:first-child`, `:last-child`, `:nth-child()`
- `:first-of-type`, `:nth-of-type()`
- Patterns like `2n`, `2n+1`, `4n+1`, etc.

We use these when we care about **which** sibling,
not just that it exists.

---

### 3️⃣ States & Spirits — **Moods & Moments**

- `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`
- `:checked`, `:disabled`, `:required`
- `:valid`, `:invalid`, `:in-range`, etc.

We use these when styling depends on **current interaction**
or **validation state** rather than static structure.

---

### 4️⃣ Arcane Attributes — **The Inscriptions**

- Exact match: `[attr="value"]`
- Token list: `[attr~=token]`
- Prefix: `[attr^="prefix"]`
- Suffix: `[attr$="suffix"]`
- Contains: `[attr*="fragment"]`

We use these when the **data model** already contains the answer,
and we’d rather not bolt on yet another utility class.

---

### 5️⃣ Unconditional Arts — **Logic & Awareness**

- `:is()` — group multiple patterns into one tail
- `:not()` — clearly define exceptions
- `:has()` — let parents react to children
- `:where()` — soft, low-specificity defaults

We use these when ordinary selectors start to feel like
they’re missing one last piece of logic.

---

## 🧪 What You’ve Practised

Across the MiniMos in this module, we’ve:

- Highlighted **direct vs descendant** elements in nested story lists
- Used **nth-child / nth-of-type** to build repeatable, patterned layouts
- Reacted to **hover, focus, valid, and checked** to change styling without JS
- Let **`data-*` attributes** control color, badges, and iconography
- Used `:is()`, `:not()`, and `:has()` to change styling based on rank, state, and inner sigils
- Kept resets and spacing sane with **`:where()`** instead of stacking specificity

Individually each MiniMo is tiny.
Together they form a **selector vocabulary** you can reuse in any project.

## 🧮 Selector Sigil Cheat Sheet

A small circle of spells to keep in view:

```css
/* Families & siblings */
.card-grid > .card                 /* direct children only */
.article + .article                /* the very next sibling */
.article ~ .article                /* all following siblings */

/* Structural runes */
.list-item:first-of-type           /* first of its kind */
.list-item:nth-of-type(2n + 1)     /* every odd item of its type */

/* Spirits of state */
input:focus-visible                /* keyboard-focused only */
input:valid                        /* passes validation */
input:checked + label              /* style label of a checked control */

/* Attribute runes */
button[data-variant="primary"]     /* exact match */
[data-tags~="featured"]            /* token in space-separated list */
[href^="https://"]                 /* starts with */
[src$=".svg"]                      /* ends with */
[data-role*="admin"]               /* contains substring */

/* Unconditional arts */
.card:is(.featured, .pinned)       /* shared styling for either */
button:not(.primary)               /* everything that isn’t primary */
.card:has(.badge--alert)           /* card reacts to child badge */
.form :where(h2, p, ul)            /* soft defaults, easy to override */
```

You don’t need all of these in every layout.  
But knowing they exist keeps your options open.

## 🎯 How to Keep Practising

A few quick drills to stay sharp:

- **Selector translation**

  - Take any complex selector from a codebase or article.
  - Write one sentence in plain English describing _exactly_ what it matches.
  - Then do the reverse: write the English first, then try to express it in CSS.

- **One layout, many spells**

  - Pick a small component (card grid, form, nav, gallery).
  - Try to style the same target using **three different selector strategies**:
    - classes only,
    - attributes + structural selectors,
    - with and without `:is()` / `:not()`.

- **DOM-first thinking**
  - Sketch a tiny HTML structure.
  - Before writing any CSS, list **which selectors** you’d reach for and why.

## 🤖 Optional: AI-Assisted Practice Prompt

When you want extra sparring practice, you can paste something like this into T.A. Watts or another assistant:

> “I’m practising CSS selectors.  
> Give me 5 small HTML snippets and, for each one,  
> 2–3 challenges like: ‘write a selector that targets X but not Y’.  
> Vary the difficulty and include answers after I guess.”

Let the assistant be the mischievous examiner;  
we stay the patient spellcaster.

- **Selector Spells Infographic** — a one-page constellation of all five selector schools
- **Selector Spells Study Guide** — the full NotebookLM-enhanced walkthrough used in the lesson video

Use these artifacts the same way the Archmage does:  
to move quickly between concept, selector, and story structure — the triad of true spellcraft.

## 🔥 Forge Ahead

We’ve bent structure, commanded siblings, whispered to states,  
read the ancient runes of attributes, and woven pure logic into the DOM.  
The Selectagon hums at our fingertips — every edge awakened.

Now we step beyond selector spellcraft  
and into the **Function Forge**,  
where values melt, units collide,  
and `calc()`, `clamp()`, and `var()`  
strike sparks against the anvil of layout itself.

Sharpen your quill, apprentice.  
The real alchemy begins.

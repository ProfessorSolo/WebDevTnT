# 📜 Relational Selectors  
*When position becomes part of the spell*

In **Relational Runes**, we studied the *Circle of Stories* and tried to guess which runes controlled the:

- red **first-born** highlight,  
- orange **rhythm** banding,  
- and pink **type-based** marker.

Now we open the spellbook and name those selectors explicitly.

Here is the core markup from the minimo:

```html
<section class="circle-panel">
  <div class="panel-label">Relational Runes · Order &amp; Type</div>
  <h2 class="panel-title">Circle of Stories</h2>

  <div class="story-list">
    <div class="story-row">
      <div>
        <p class="story-kicker">Feature · First in the circle</p>
        <h3 class="story-title">The First-Born Selector</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="story-meta">We meet <code>:first-child</code> and see how it crowns the first element in a group.</p>
        <p class="story-summary">Only one item can ever be first. Sometimes that’s all the magic we need.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="story-row">
      <div>
        <p class="story-kicker">Dispatch · Second in line</p>
        <h3 class="story-title">Even the Middle Children Matter</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="story-meta">Banding and stripes appear when we start counting with <code>:nth-child()</code>.</p>
        <p class="story-summary">By alternating odd and even rows, we make long lists friendlier to read.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="interlude-row">
      <div class="interlude-pill">
        <span>AD INTERLUDE</span>
        <span>— not a story, still a child</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="story-row">
      <div>
        <p class="story-kicker">Column · Third of its kind</p>
        <h3 class="story-title">Of Type, Not Just of Birth</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="story-meta"><code>:nth-of-type()</code> ignores the ad and finds the third story anyway.</p>
        <p class="story-summary">Sometimes we count only among our own kind, and the divs in the middle don’t matter.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="story-row">
      <div>
        <p class="story-kicker">Closing Note</p>
        <h3 class="story-title">Last, But Not Forgotten</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="story-meta">With <code>:last-child</code>, we can soften the landing at the end of any sequence.</p>
        <p class="story-summary">Margins, borders, and flourishes don’t always have to repeat forever.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

## 🟥 First-Born Highlight — `:first-child` and Friends

We wanted the **first story row** to feel special.

```css
/* Option A — first child of the story list */
.story-list > .story-row:first-child {
  /* red border & glow */
}

/* Option B — equivalent with :nth-child() */
.story-list > .story-row:nth-child(1) {
  /* red border & glow */
}
```

Both read as “the first child of `.story-list` that is a `.story-row`.”

- `:first-child` is a little easier to scan.  
- `:nth-child(1)` becomes handy when we later refactor to `2n + 1` patterns and want the consistency.

---

## 🟧 Rhythm Banding — `:nth-child()` vs `:nth-of-type()`

We also wanted a repeating orange band on every other **story row**.

Because the `div.interlude-row` lives between rows 2 and 3, we have a choice:

```css
/* Option A — band every odd child, counting the interlude */
.story-list > *:nth-child(odd) {
  /* background band */
}

/* Option B — band every odd story-row only, ignoring the interlude */
.story-list > .story-row:nth-of-type(odd) {
  /* background band */
}
```

- Option A says, “Every odd child, whatever it is.”  
- Option B says, “Every odd `.story-row`, ignoring other types in the list.”

In the minimo, we used **type-based banding** so that the ad doesn’t break the visual rhythm across stories.

---

## 💗 Type-Based Marker — `:nth-of-type()` in Action

We wanted a pink badge on the **third story**, even though it’s not the third child (the ad interrupts).

```css
/* Third story-row of its type */
.story-list > .story-row:nth-of-type(3) .story-kicker::before {
  content: "TYPE·III";
  /* pink badge styles */
}
```

If we had used `:nth-child(3)`, the selector would have grabbed the `interlude-row` instead, because it is the actual third child.

`nth-of-type()` lets us say:

> “Third `div.story-row` among its siblings, ignoring other tags.”

---

## 🧵 Soft Landing — `:last-child` vs `:last-of-type()`

Finally, we may want to soften the last story row—removing extra borders or adding spacing.

```css
/* Option A — last child of the list, whatever it is */
.story-list > .story-row:last-child {
  /* soften bottom border, margin, etc. */
}

/* Option B — last story-row, even if something comes after it */
.story-list > .story-row:last-of-type {
  /* soften bottom border, margin, etc. */
}
```

Right now, both options behave the same because the last child happens to be a `.story-row`.

If we later added a footer or another `div` beneath the stories:

- `:last-child` would stop matching the final story.  
- `:last-of-type` would continue to treat the final story-row as “last.”

## 🧠 Takeaways

Relational selectors let us:

- encode **position** directly into the selector,  
- choose whether to count **all children** or only those of a certain **type**,  
- avoid adding extra “first/last/featured” classes in simple cases.

When deciding between them, we can ask:

- “If I insert an extra element in the middle, will this selector still mean what I think it means?”  
- “Am I really counting children, or am I counting *stories*, *rows*, or some other conceptual group?”

When the answer is clear, the rune almost picks itself.

Next up: **States & Spirits**, where these elements start to respond to hovers, focus, and form validation.

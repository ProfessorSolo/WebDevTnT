Welcome, apprentices of the arcane stylesheet arts.  
Today we begin our journey into **Selectromancy** — the subtle, essential magic of _finding exactly the right element_ before we cast any stylistic spell.

Before gradients shimmer, before transitions glide, before animations roar to life, there is one rule we all embrace:

> **A spell only works when it reaches its true target.**

Selectromancy gives us clarity and intention.  
It ensures our CSS is purposeful, readable, and resilient.  
Every layout, every motion effect, every responsive choice in our A04 News‑Style Portfolio Homepage rests on this foundation.

## 🪄 What We’ll Explore Together

Our journey leads us through five Schools of Selector Magic:

- **Familial Sorcery** — parent → child relationships, siblings, ancestry
- **Relational Runes** — the order of elements: first, last, nth
- **States & Spirits** — hover, focus, valid, invalid, and UI reactions
- **Arcane Attributes** — the metadata magics `[attr]`, `[attr$=]`, and beyond
- **The Unforbidden Arts** — `:not()`, `:is()`, `:where()`, and the ever‑mighty `:has()`

Each school contains:

- an intro page to set the theme
- a spellbook page with tabs for practical mastery
- minimo examples in the spellbook pages only

This page is simply the Academy gates—the moment where the journey begins.

## 🧭 Why Begin With Selectromancy?

Many beginners try to style _before_ they learn to _target_.  
Together, we’ll avoid:

- vague selectors that grab too much
- overly specific selectors that fight us later
- CSS overrides that cascade into chaos
- the dreaded “why isn’t my CSS working?” spiral
- tangled rules that make refactoring painful

Instead, we build habits that reward us with:

- precision
- clarity
- intentionality
- maintainability
- confidence

Selectromancy is how we write CSS that behaves—and keeps behaving.

## 🔮 What We Gain on This Journey

By the end of this discipline, we’ll be able to:

- recognize selector families instantly
- understand DOM relationships at a glance
- choose the right tool for any structural or visual task
- simplify our A04 layouts with smarter selectors
- write CSS that tells a clean, expressive story

This is our first step into the academy of selection magic.  
Let’s open the spellbook and begin.

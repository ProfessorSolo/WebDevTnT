# 🏛️ Familial Sorcery

_Reading the branches of the DOM_

Every spell in Selectromancy begins with a question:

> **“Where does this element live in the family tree?”**

**Familial Sorcery** is the school where we learn to read that tree.

We care about:

- who is _inside_ whom,
- who is a _direct child_,
- who comes _right after_ something,
- and who simply shares the same parent further down the line.

In CSS, that family knowledge is expressed through **combinators**:

- Descendant: `A B`
- Direct child: `A > B`
- Adjacent sibling: `A + B`
- General sibling: `A ~ B`

Before we name each spell in detail, we watch them at work.

## ✨ MiniMo — The Hall of Stories

Below is a small, self-contained minimo rendered with the shared MiniMo component.  
Everything you see here is driven by **family relationships** between elements—plus a bit of hover magic.

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/css-selector-spells/m10-familial-hall-of-stories.html"
  title="Familial Sorcery — Hall of Stories"
  height="560px"
/>

As you hover and read, notice:

- The **green title** marks the true heir: a `.story-title` that is a **direct child** of `.story`.
- The other title is white: still a descendant, but nested one level deeper inside `.story-inner`.
- Amber meta lines sit immediately after titles, and shift together with them.
- A purple divider and closing line mark everything that is a **sibling after** the hall heading, never the heading itself.

Those colors match our quest types below and hint at which combinators are doing the work.

## 🧩 Quest Notes — Decoding the Hall

Let’s treat this like a page torn from a spellbook.  
No CSS is shown yet; we only have the behavior and the DOM structure to guide our guesses.

Color legend:

- 🟦 **Structure quests** (descendants / containers) — blue
- 🟩 **Heir quests** (direct children) — green
- 🟨 **Whisper quests** (immediate followers) — amber
- 🟪 **Sibling quests** (beside/after, not self) — purple

### 🟦 Quest I — The Hall’s Embrace

How might we write one or more selectors that:

- style **every story card** inside the hall,
- but avoid accidentally styling stories that might live elsewhere on the page?

Think in terms of “hall” as the container and “story” as the descendants.

---

### 🟩 Quest II — The True Heir

Look closely at the two stories:

- In the first, the title appears **inside** a nested `.story-inner`.
- In the second, the title sits **directly inside** `.story` and glows green.

How might we:

- write a selector that catches **both** titles as descendants of `.story`, and
- write a different selector that only treats titles that are **direct children** of `.story` as special?

---

### 🟨 Quest III — The Whisper That Follows

Each title has an amber meta line (“Arcane CSS · 3 min read”, “DOM Lore · 2 min read”) that follows it.

How might we write a selector that:

- styles that meta line,
- **only when it appears immediately after** a story title,
- without naming any extra classes?

Hint: this is about who stands directly beside whom in the family tree.

---

### 🟪 Quest IV — Siblings, Not Self

Everything that comes after the “Hall of Stories” heading has a purple-tinted divider and closing note.

The heading itself does **not** have that line.

How might we write a selector that:

- treats “everything that is a sibling after the hall title” as a group,
- but never styles the title itself?

This is our first big clue that **sibling selectors never include self**—  
they always talk about the brothers and sisters _beside_ and _after_ the target, not the target itself.

When Tinkerbell rings her bell like this:  
`* ~ * ~ * ~ *`

…we turn to **02 — Familial Selectors** and reveal the runes behind the effect, comparing different ways to reach the same elements.

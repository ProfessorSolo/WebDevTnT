# 🔮 Unconditional Arts  
*Where CSS grows a mind of its own*

By now we’ve studied:

- the **bloodlines** of the DOM (familial sorcery),  
- the **order of things** (relational runes),  
- the **spirits of interaction** (states & spirits),  
- and the **inscribed sigils** (attribute arcana).  

But there is a deeper, more elusive discipline:

> **The Unconditional Arts** — spellwork that bends styling with *logic itself.*

Here we channel the runes:

- `:is()` — speak **one spell that fits many shapes**  
- `:not()` — declare **what must be cast aside**  
- `:has()` — let **parents awaken to the secrets their children hold**  
- `:where()` — the **soft incantation**, lowering the weight of the spell

Together, they allow selectors that reason, filter, exclude, and respond.

Before naming them outright, let’s witness their magic etched into a relic of the Academy.

## ✨ MiniMo — The Chamber of Unconditionals

A set of enchanted glyph tablets sits in a floating grid.  
Some glow by **lineage**, others by **sigils embedded within**,  
others fade if marked with the rune **Sealed**.

Every glow, shimmer, and pulse is driven by an Unconditional.

  height="640px"
/>

As we hover our gaze, observe:

- Several tablets radiate the same **cyan aura**,  
  though their inscriptions differ — a grouped charm is at work.
- Some tablets dim, as if drained of mana — **exclusion runes** govern them.
- Others pulse with violet even when their status glyph says nothing —  
  a **parent has sensed something within**.
- And the spacing and calm rhythm of the chamber holds steady —  
  soft layout magic set by **`:where()`**.

## 🧩 Quest Notes — Decode the Chamber

Color legend for this minimo:

- 🟦 **Cyan Rune** — grouped logic (`:is()`)  
- 🟧 **Amber Rune** — exclusions (`:not()`)  
- 🟪 **Violet Rune** — parent awakening (`:has()`)  
- 🌫 **Slate Mist** — soft defaults (`:where()`)

### 🟦 Quest I — The Tablets of Many Faces

Several tablets glow as one, even though their inscriptions differ.

Which rune would allow:

> **“Whether the tablet bears Glyph-A *or* Glyph-B,  
> treat them both as adepts of the same order”**

…without repeating the entire tail of the spell twice?

---

### 🟧 Quest II — The Ghosted Tools

Some buttons shimmer bright with intent.  
Others feel faint, ghost-like, half-present.

If the spell recognizes **only the marked tools as primary**,  
what charm says:

> “All **others** fade except the ones of my choosing”?

---

### 🟪 Quest III — The Violet Secrets

One tablet pulses with arcane energy.  
Why?  
Because inside it lies a hidden glyph — a **Beta Sigil** —  
and the parent tablet senses it.

Which rune lets a container react to its contents?

Which rune blocks that reaction when the tablet is marked **Sealed**?

---

### 🌫 Quest IV — The Mist of Low Weight

Some incantations in CSS shout with force.  
Others whisper.

Which rune lets us write:

> “Let these rules be soft.  
> Easy to override.  
> A calm baseline, not a contest of power.”

# 🧿 Arcane Attributes  
*Selectors that read the runes etched into HTML*

Earlier schools taught us to read:

- the **family tree** (combinators),  
- the **order of siblings** (relational runes),  
- the **moods of interaction** (states & spirits).  

**Arcane Attributes** focus on a different question:

> **What secrets are already carved into the attributes?**

Attribute selectors let our CSS respond to:

- the **type** of an element,  
- custom `data-*` metadata,  
- whether a token appears in a space-separated list,  
- whether a value starts with, ends with, or contains a string fragment.

In this school we meet:

- `[attr="value"]`  
- `[attr~=token]`  
- `[attr^="prefix"]`  
- `[attr$="suffix"]`  
- `[attr*="middle"]`

## ✨ MiniMo — Relic Registry

This minimo shows a **Relic Registry** from the Academy:

- some entries are **relics**, others are **tomes**,  
- some are marked as **unstable**,  
- some belong to **primal** schools,  
- one hides the word **storm** in its school name,  
- some regions sit in the **north**,  
- some records link into distant **astral archives**.

Every neon accent is driven by an attribute selector.

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/css-selector-spells/m10-arcane-attribute-registry.html"
  title="Arcane Attributes — Relic Registry"
  height="640px"
/>

As we read it, notice:

- Relics vs tomes get different border glows.  
- Any relic whose aspects include **unstable** has orange-tag accents.  
- Primal schools tint their label with cyan.  
- The storm codex title thrums with a rose glow.  
- Some entries wear a **NORTH** badge floating in the corner.  
- Astral archive links light up their tiny round glyph.

No new classes were needed — just the attributes we were already likely to have.

## 🧩 Quest Notes — Decoding the Registry

Color legend for this minimo:

- 🟩 **Exact rune** — lime border for `data-type="relic"`  
- 🟧 **Token rune** — orange tags when `data-aspects` includes `unstable`  
- 🟦 **Prefix rune** — cyan label when `data-school` starts with `primal`  
- 🟥 **Contains rune** — rose title glow when `data-school` mentions `storm`  
- 🟪 **Suffix rune** — violet badge when `data-region` ends with `-north`

### 🟩 Quest I — Relics vs Tomes

Compare the borders and halos of relic entries vs tome entries.

- What differences do we see in color and glow?  
- How could we express **“relic only”** and **“tome only”** using exact attribute matches on `data-type`?

Think in terms of:

- `[data-type="relic"]` vs `[data-type="tome"]`.

---

### 🟧 Quest II — The Unstable Token

Only one artifact clearly leans into **unstable** energy.

Look at its `data-aspects` list in the markup and at the tags themselves.

- Why would we store aspects as a **space-separated list** instead of a single string?  
- How might we target entries whose `data-aspects` list includes the token `unstable`?

Hint: there’s a selector designed for **token membership**.

---

### 🟦🟥 Quest III — Primal vs Stormbound

Look at the **school** labels and names:

- Some schools start with `primal-` (primal-ember, primal-storm).  
- One school hides the word `storm` in the middle.

How could we:

- style any entry where `data-school` **starts with** `primal`, and  
- separately, style any entry where `data-school` **contains** `storm` anywhere in the value?

Think about `^=` for prefixes and `*=` for substrings.

---

### 🟪 Quest IV — Regions Ending in -north

Two entries carry a little **NORTH** badge near the top-right corner.

Check their `data-region` values in the markup.

- What do those have in common?  
- How might we express “ends with `-north`” in a selector?

This is our first gentle glimpse at `$=` suffix matching.

In **08 — Attribute Selectors**, we’ll open the spellbook and show each rune in full,  
mapping them one by one to the exact effects you’ve just spotted.

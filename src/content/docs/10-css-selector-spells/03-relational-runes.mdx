# 🔮 Relational Runes

_The order and lineage of elements_

Familial Sorcery told us **who is related to whom**.  
**Relational Runes** go further and ask:

> **“Where does this element sit among its siblings?”**

Here we care about:

- who is **first** or **last**,
- who is **nth in line**,
- and who is the third, fourth, or fifth of its **type**, even when other elements sit in between.

We’ll soon meet:

- `:first-child` / `:last-child`
- `:nth-child()`
- `:first-of-type` / `:last-of-type`
- `:nth-of-type()`

Before we break them down, we watch the runes at work.

## ✨ MiniMo — The Circle of Stories

This minimo shows a small sequence of stories, plus an interlude that interrupts the flow.

The visuals are wired to **where** each element falls in the sequence, and whether it is **a story** or something else.

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/css-selector-spells/m10-relational-circle-of-stories.html"
  title="Relational Runes — Circle of Stories"
  height="640px"
/>

As you read it, notice:

- One story at the top glows with an electric **red halo**.
- A soft **orange banding** runs through every other story row.
- A specific story in the lower half wears a **hot pink “TYPE·III” marker**.
- There’s an **ad interlude** in the middle that clearly participates in the child order, but not in the “story-of-type” counting.

Those are all clues about `:first-child`, `:nth-child()`, and `:nth-of-type()`.

## 🧩 Quest Notes — Reading the Circle

We’ll keep the CSS hidden for now.  
Our job is to read the pattern and guess which relational runes might be in play.

Color legend for this minimo:

- 🟥 **First-born rune** — electric red (first child of the group)
- 🟧 **Rhythm rune** — electric orange (odd/even banding)
- 💗 **Kindred-type rune** — hot pink (counting only among stories, not ads)

---

### 🟥 Quest I — The First-Born

The topmost story carries a strong red glow around its row and title.

How might we write selectors that:

- treat this first story as special,
- without needing a special class on it,
- and still keep the rest of the list generic?

Think about `:first-child` and `:nth-child(1)`—  
and why we might pick one over the other.

---

### 🟧 Quest II — The Rhythm of the List

Every other story row carries an orange-tinted band behind it.

Look carefully at **which** rows are banded:

- Which stories get the orange treatment?
- Does the ad interlude break the pattern, or is the rhythm still easy to follow?

How might we express this rhythm with `:nth-child()` or `:nth-of-type()`?

---

### 💗 Quest III — Of Type, Not Just of Birth

One story lower down carries a hot pink “TYPE·III” badge next to its kicker.

Yet there’s an ad between the second and third stories.

How might we write a selector that:

- finds the **third story article**,
- even though it is **not** the third child of the parent element,
- and clearly ignores the interlude div when counting?

This is where `:nth-of-type()` quietly shows off.

---

### 🟥🟧💗 Quest IV — The Closing Note

The final story doesn’t have its own new color, but the copy hints at **“Last, But Not Forgotten.”**

What kinds of selectors could we use to subtly soften the ending of a sequence?

Think about:

- `:last-child` vs `:last-of-type()`
- and how they might behave differently if we added more non-story children after the last story.

When Tinkerbell rings her bell like this:  
`* : * : * : *`

…we turn to **04 — Relational Selectors** and lay out several different selector spells side by side, all targeting the same positions in the Circle.

## \<input\>

The input element(s), within a form, are the fields that a user fills out.

```html
<form action="/signup" method="post" name="signupForm">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    id="username"
    name="username"
    placeholder="Enter your username"
    required
  />

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input
    type="email"
    id="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="you@example.com"
    required
  />

  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input
    type="password"
    id="password"
    name="password"
    pattern=".{8,}"
    placeholder="Minimum 8 characters"
    required
  />

  <input type="submit" value="Create Account" />
</form>
```

There are a variety of input "types" which determine the type of data that should be entered by the user. We'll look at the most common input types momentarily.

Common input tag attributes include:

- type
  - determines the type of data expected
- name
  - identifies the input for the server
  - used by radio and checkbox input types for grouping
- id
  - used to uniquely identify the input for CSS/JS as well as for associating labels with a specific input
- disabled
  - prevents user input and does not send a value for this input to the server
- readonly
  - similar to disabled, but does send a value to the server
- required
  - prevents form submission until there is a value entered
- placeholder
  - displays prompt text in text inputs. note: this attribute is not read by screen readers and requires a workaround for accessibility
- pattern
  - defines a regular expression pattern that is used for data validation before the form data is sent - without JavaScript

## `<textarea>`

The `<textarea>` element is used to accept multiple lines or large amounts of text — for example, comment boxes or feedback forms.

Unlike text inputs, `<textarea>` is **not** a self-closing tag.

In addition to the **name** and **id** attributes, useful attributes for textarea elements include:

- **rows** — controls the height of the element, expressed as the number of lines of text to display
- **cols** — defines the width of the element, similar to the `size` attribute of text inputs

> **Note:** The `<textarea>` element does **not** use the `value` attribute to set its initial contents.  
> To pre-populate a textarea, place the desired text between the opening and closing `<textarea>` tags.

```html
<form action="/feedback" method="post" name="commentForm">
  <label for="comments">Your Comments:</label>
  <textarea
    id="comments"
    name="comments"
    rows="5"
    cols="40"
    placeholder="Enter your feedback here..."
    required
  >

</textarea

  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

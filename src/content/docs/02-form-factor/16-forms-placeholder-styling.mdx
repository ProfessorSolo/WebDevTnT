## Styling Placeholders

Even though placeholders are not sufficient for accessibility (a11y), we can still use them â€” **as long as each input also has a proper label**, even if that label is visually hidden.

Styling placeholders, however, can be a little tricky.

From a CSS perspective, placeholder text is a **pseudo-element**, not the actual content of the input.  
To control its styling, use the `::placeholder` pseudo-element selector.

```css
input::placeholder {
  color: blue;
  opacity: 1;
}
```

By default, Firefox renders placeholder text with reduced opacity.  
To maintain consistent appearance across browsers, explicitly set the **opacity** value.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** You can apply the same pseudo-element to other form elements such as `<textarea>`:
>
> ```css
> textarea::placeholder {
>   color: #666;
>   opacity: 1;
> }
> ```

## HTML5 Form Validation

HTML5 introduced built-in validation mechanisms that run **in the browser** before form data is sent to the server.

For example, adding the **required** attribute to an input element forces the user to enter data before the form can be submitted.

Some of the newer input types, such as `<input type="email">`, go further and automatically validate user input against predefined rules.  
For instance, email addresses must include characters before and after an **@** symbol, a **.**, and at least one character following the dot.

```html
<form action="/signup" method="post" name="validationExample">
  <label for="email">Email Address:</label>
  <input
    type="email"
    id="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="you@example.com"
    required
  />

  <br /><br />

  <label for="age">Age:</label>
  <input type="number" id="age" name="age" min="18" max="99" required />

  <br /><br />

  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

The `:valid` and `:invalid` CSS pseudo-classes are automatically applied based on each fieldâ€™s current value, allowing you to visually indicate whether the data entered is acceptable.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** HTML5 validation improves usability but doesnâ€™t replace server-side validation â€” always validate form data again on the server for security.

## `<input type="hidden" ... >`

An input with `type="hidden"` is not displayed visually, but its **value** is still sent as part of the form data when the form is submitted.

This can be useful when you want to send data along with the form that you do not want — or need — the user to enter themselves.

For example, if a user is logged in to your website, their **user ID** could be included as a hidden value when they submit a checkout or contact form, allowing you to associate the submission with their account without exposing or editable that data in the UI.

```html
<form action="/checkout" method="post" name="orderForm">
  <label for="product">Product:</label>
  <select id="product" name="product" required>
    <option value="">-- Select a product --</option>
    <option value="widget">Widget</option>
    <option value="gadget">Gadget</option>
  </select>

  <!-- hidden field storing user ID -->
  <input type="hidden" name="userId" value="12345" />

  <br /><br />

  <input type="submit" value="Purchase" />
</form>
```

<CautionBox>
  ⚠️ **Caution:** Although password inputs visually hide the characters on
  screen, the data is *not encrypted or secure* by default. Password values can
  still be inspected in the browser’s DevTools or intercepted if the form is not
  submitted over HTTPS. Always handle password data securely on the server and
  use HTTPS for all authentication-related forms.

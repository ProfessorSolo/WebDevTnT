## \<form\> ... \<\/form\>

The form element wraps input fields and controls how and where the data is sent.

```html
<form action="/submit-form" method="post" name="contactForm">
  <!-- form fields go here -->
</form>
```

The form tag should include, at minimum, the following attributes:

- action
  - The URL of the form processing endpoint (file)
- method

  - How the data is sent for processing \

    - get
      - data is sent via URL parameters
      - useful for search and other non-sensitive data
    - post
      - data is sent in the body of the HTTP request
      - this is the most common method

- name
  - offers a way to identify the form to the server

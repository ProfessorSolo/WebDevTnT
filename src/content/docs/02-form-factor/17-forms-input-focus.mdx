## `:focus` Pseudo-Class

When users navigate a form â€” either by clicking into fields or tabbing between them â€” changing the visual style of the currently focused input helps them understand **where they are** within the form.

This can be achieved using the `:focus` pseudo-class in CSS.

```css
input:focus {
  outline: 2px solid dodgerblue;
  background-color: #eef6ff;
}
```

This rule will highlight the active input with a blue outline and a subtle background color, improving both usability and accessibility.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Always ensure your focus styles are visible and meet contrast requirements â€” never remove outlines without providing an accessible replacement.

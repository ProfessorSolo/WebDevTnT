## Pattern Attribute

Beyond the built-in validation provided by **required** and input typeâ€“specific rules (`email`, `url`, etc.), HTML5 also provides the **pattern** attribute, allowing you to validate input against a **regular expression** (regex).

Regular expressions are patterns that the browser uses to test strings of text against defined rules.  
You can read more about regex on [MDNâ€™s Regular Expressions Cheatsheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Cheatsheet).

With the `pattern` attribute, you can validate things like credit card numbers, postal codes, phone numbers, and more.

Regex syntax can be challenging, but there are great resources with pre-written HTML5 patterns such as [html5pattern.com](https://www.html5pattern.com/).

You can use the **title** attribute on an input to define helper text displayed when the value fails validation.  
Since not all browsers read the validation tooltip aloud, itâ€™s a good idea to include an **aria-label** with the same instructional information for screen readers.

```html
<form action="/signup" method="post" name="usernameForm">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    name="username"
    id="username"
    placeholder="Username..."
    required
    pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9]+"
    title="Username can only contain alpha-numeric characters"
    aria-label="Username containing only alpha-numeric characters"
  />

  <input type="submit" value="Create Account" />
</form>
```

Any field that fails validation can be styled using the `:invalid` pseudo-class to provide visual feedback for users.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Combine `pattern`, `title`, and `aria-label` attributes to ensure both usability and accessibility in your form validation.

## `<input type="radio" ... >`

Similar to `<input type="checkbox">`, radio inputs allow the user to select between a group of values â€” but in a mutually exclusive manner.

Radio inputs are grouped by their shared **name** attribute.

The data that is sent when the form is submitted is based on the **value** attribute of the currently checked item.

The **checked** attribute controls which of the radio buttons is selected when the form initially loads.

```html
<form action="/survey" method="post" name="favoriteLanguage">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Select your favorite programming language</legend>

    <label>
      <input type="radio" name="language" value="javascript" checked />
      JavaScript
    </label>

    <label>
      <input type="radio" name="language" value="python" />
      Python
    </label>

    <label>
      <input type="radio" name="language" value="java" />
      Java
    </label>

    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

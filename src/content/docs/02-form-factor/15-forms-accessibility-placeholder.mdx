## Placeholder Attribute Accessibility Issues

Most text-based inputs have an optional **placeholder** attribute, which can be used to provide a hint about the expected data or format for that field.

This can seem useful and visually clean — but **placeholders are _not_ a substitute for labels**.

> ❌ **Important:** Placeholders are _not read_ by screen readers, while labels — associated with inputs via the `for` and `id` attributes — _are_.  
> Users relying on assistive technology will miss your form’s purpose entirely if you omit labels.

---

### Always Use Labels

**Never** omit `<label>` tags in your markup.  
People using screen readers depend on labels to understand and navigate forms correctly.

If you want to hide labels for aesthetic reasons, you can visually hide them while keeping them accessible.  
However, using `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;` will also hide them from screen readers.

---

### ✅ Correct Approach

Use a visually hidden class to keep labels accessible but invisible on screen.

```css
.visually-hidden {
  position: absolute !important;
  width: 1px !important;
  height: 1px !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
  margin: -1px !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0) !important;
  white-space: nowrap !important;
  border: 0 !important;
}
```

### 💡 Tip

Frameworks like **Bootstrap** already include this as `.visually-hidden` (previously `.sr-only`).

---

### 🧠 Developer’s Rule

> ⚠️ **Do not be a lazy developer!**  
> Always include `<label>` tags and tie them to their inputs using `for` on the label and a matching `id` on the input.

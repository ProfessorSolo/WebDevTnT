## Same Goal, Different Eras

Gulp and Vite both exist for the same reason:

To make front-end development manageable at scale.

They just come from **different eras** of the web.

---

## The Core Question Each Tool Asks

Every tool is shaped by the problem it tries to answer.

**Gulp asks:**  
“How do we process files efficiently?”

**Vite asks:**  
“How do we run a fast, modern development environment?”

That difference drives everything else.

---

## Pipelines vs Platforms

**Gulp**

- task-based
- file-in / file-out
- build-first mindset
- explicit pipelines

**Vite**

- environment-based
- dev server at the center
- dev-first mindset
- implicit workflows

Both work.

Only one scales cleanly today.

## Development Experience

With Gulp:

- you run tasks
- you wait for output
- you refresh the browser
- you debug the pipeline

With Vite:

- you edit files
- the browser updates instantly
- state is preserved
- the tooling disappears

Speed changes how you think.

---

## Configuration Surface Area

**Gulp**

- many plugins
- lots of glue code
- custom wiring
- easy to break unintentionally

**Vite**

- minimal config
- opinionated defaults
- plugins stay isolated
- fewer moving parts

Less surface area means fewer problems.

---

## Build Timing

**Gulp**

- build is constant
- optimization happens all the time
- feedback slows as projects grow

**Vite**

- build is deferred
- optimization happens once
- development stays fast

Different priorities.

---

## When You’ll Still See Gulp

This isn’t about erasing history.

You’ll still encounter Gulp in:

- legacy projects
- older CMS themes
- inherited codebases

Understanding it helps you read those projects calmly.

---

## Why Vite Won

Vite didn’t win by adding features.

It won by:

- aligning with modern browsers
- removing unnecessary steps
- separating development from production

The web finally caught up.

---

## The Takeaway

Gulp taught developers how to automate.

Vite removed the need to think about automation at all.

That’s progress.

## ⏭ Zoom Out

Now that the contrast is clear, it’s time to step back and lock in the mental models that will help you reason about _any_ tool you meet next.

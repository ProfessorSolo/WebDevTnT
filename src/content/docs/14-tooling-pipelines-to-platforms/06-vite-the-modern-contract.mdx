## A Different Question

    Vite splits the workflow: lightning-fast module-based development, followed
    by an optimized production build.

Pipeline-based tools asked:

“How do we process files?”

Modern tooling asks a different question:

“How do we run front-end development?”

That shift changes everything.

## Vite Is Not a Task Runner

Vite is not a collection of build steps.

It is a **development platform**.

Instead of defining pipelines, Vite provides:

- a dev server
- file watching
- instant reload
- a production build step

All from a single foundation.

---

## HTML Is the Entry Point

One of the biggest mental shifts Vite introduces:

Your app starts at **`index.html`**.

Not a config file.  
Not a build script.

The browser loads HTML.  
Everything else flows from there.

This aligns tooling with how the web actually works.

---

## Native Modules, Finally

Modern browsers support ES modules.

Vite takes advantage of that:

- files are served directly
- imports work natively
- no bundling during development

You edit a file.
The browser reloads instantly.

No pipeline required.

---

## Dev First, Build Later

With Vite, development and build are **separate phases**.

- Development is fast and unbundled
- Builds happen once, at the end
- Optimization is deferred until it matters

This eliminates the slow feedback loops of pipeline-based tools.

---

## Plugins Replace Pipelines

Where Gulp required glue code, Vite uses plugins.

Each plugin:

- hooks into the dev server
- extends behavior
- stays isolated

Tailwind.
Sass.
TypeScript.

They all plug into the same contract.

---

## Why Frameworks Chose Vite

React.
Vue.
Svelte.
Astro.

They didn’t choose Vite because it was trendy.

They chose it because:

- it matches modern browser capabilities
- it minimizes configuration
- it keeps tooling invisible

The platform fades into the background.

---

## The New Baseline

Vite replaces:

- task runners
- manual watchers
- custom build glue

Not by doing more —  
but by **doing less, better**.

It becomes the ground everything else stands on.

## ⏭ Under the Hood

Vite feels simple on the surface.

Next, we’ll peek just enough under the hood to understand _why_ it feels that way — without falling into config rabbit holes.

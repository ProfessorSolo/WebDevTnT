## This Is About Thinking, Not Building

You are not writing code in this exercise.

You are **reading a setup** and explaining what it does.

That’s a skill you will use constantly in the real world.

---

## Exercise 1: Spot the Platform

Open a modern front-end project (React, Vue, Astro, etc.) and answer:

- What starts the dev server?
- Where does development begin?
- Is there a build step?
- When does bundling happen?

You don’t need to know *every* detail.

You need to know **where the ground is**.

---

## Exercise 2: Identify the Model

Look for clues:

- Is there a dev server command?
- Are files served directly or processed first?
- Is there a clear separation between dev and build?

Then answer:

> Is this project pipeline-based or platform-based?

Explain *why*.

---

## Exercise 3: Legacy Literacy

Now imagine you open an older project and see:

- a `gulpfile.js`
- a `dist/` folder
- many plugins wired together

Answer:

- What problems was this toolchain solving?
- Why was it reasonable at the time?
- What pain points might exist today?

Context matters.

---

## Exercise 4: Reason Without Judgment

For each setup you inspect:

- avoid “this is bad”
- avoid “this is outdated”

Instead ask:

- *what problem was this solving?*
- *what assumptions does it make?*

That mindset keeps you effective.

## What You Should Walk Away With

If you can:

- identify the tooling model
- explain why it exists
- predict its strengths and weaknesses

You’re doing it right.

## Invisible Until It Isn’t

One of Vite’s biggest strengths is that you rarely have to think about it.

You run a command.  
A server starts.  
Things just work.

But understanding *why* they work makes everything else easier.

---

## The Dev Server Is the Product

With Vite, the dev server isn’t a convenience.

It **is the tool**.

Its job is to:
- serve files to the browser
- watch for changes
- respond instantly when something updates

Everything else builds on that.

---

## Native ES Modules in Action

When the browser requests a file:

- Vite serves it directly
- imports are resolved on demand
- only the files you touch are reloaded

There’s no giant bundle being rebuilt on every save.

That’s why it feels instant.

---

## Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

When you edit a file:

- Vite detects the change
- sends only the updated module
- the browser swaps it in

The page doesn’t fully reload.

State stays intact.

That tight feedback loop is the difference between *working* and *waiting*.

---

## Why There’s No Bundling (Yet)

Bundling is expensive.

So Vite doesn’t do it during development.

Instead:
- files stay separate
- the browser does the linking
- speed stays high

Bundling happens later — when it actually matters.

---

## The Build Step Is Still There

Vite isn’t skipping optimization.

It’s **deferring it**.

When you run `vite build`:
- files are bundled
- assets are optimized
- output is production-ready

Same project.  
Different phase.

---

## Less Configuration by Design

Because the browser does more of the work:

- fewer defaults are needed
- fewer rules are required
- fewer edge cases appear

This is why most Vite projects have very small config files.

Or none at all.

---

## The Mental Model to Keep

Think of Vite as:

- a smart file server
- with opinions about speed
- and just enough build logic to ship

Not a pile of tasks.

Not a maze of scripts.

Just ground to stand on.

---

## ⏭ Cement the Contrast

Now that you’ve seen how Vite works, it’s time to put it directly next to the old model and lock the difference in place.

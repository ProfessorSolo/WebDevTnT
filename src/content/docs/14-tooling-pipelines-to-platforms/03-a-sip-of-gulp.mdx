## Meet the Task Runner

At some point, developers stopped asking:

> “How do I remember to do all this?”

And started asking:

> “Why am I doing this by hand at all?”

That question gave rise to **task runners**.

## What Is Gulp?

Gulp is a **task runner**.

It doesn’t change your code.  
It doesn’t understand your app.

It simply automates **steps you already know how to do**.

You define tasks.  
Gulp runs them.  
Every time.  
The same way.

---

## The Core Idea: Pipelines

At the heart of Gulp is a simple model:

**files → transformations → output**

Each task is a pipeline:

- read files from disk
- pass them through a series of steps
- write the result somewhere else

Nothing magical.  
Just automation.

## What Gulp Was Great At

In its time, Gulp solved very real problems:

- image optimization
- JavaScript concatenation
- minification
- copying files into a `dist/` folder

Instead of doing these steps manually, you ran **one command**.

That was a huge win.

---

## Why Developers Loved It

Gulp felt:

- fast
- explicit
- predictable

You could open a `gulpfile.js` and _see the entire build process_.

No mystery.  
No hidden behavior.

For a while, this was exactly what the web needed.

---

## Important Framing

Let’s be very clear:

- This is **not** a recommendation.
- This is **not** a modern default.
- This is **not** something you’re expected to adopt.

This is context.

Understanding Gulp helps you understand **what came next**.

---

## A Controlled Taste

We’re going to take a **very small sip**:

- one `gulpfile.js`
- a few focused tasks
- no watchers
- no Sass
- no plugins beyond the essentials

Just enough to understand the model.

Then we move on.

## ⏭ Enter the Pipeline: **A Minimal Gulp Build**

Let’s wire up a simple pipeline and see what “automation” looked like before modern platforms took over.

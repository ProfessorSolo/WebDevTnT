## Why We’re Starting Here

Welcome back.

Before we write more CSS.  
Before we go atomic with Tailwind.  
We need to talk about **how modern front-end work actually runs**.

Not frameworks.  
Not syntax.

**Tooling.**

Because every line of code we write lives inside a system that:

- watches files
- reloads browsers
- transforms assets
- and eventually produces something shippable

Most of the time, that system is invisible.

Today, we make it visible.

## A Quick Reset

You’ve already been using modern tooling.

- Vite in React
- Vite in Vue
- Vite under Angular’s hood

But for most of you, that experience has been:

> “Run this command. Don’t touch anything else.”

That’s fine... until something breaks.

This chapter is about understanding **what that tooling is doing**, and _why it exists at all_.

---

## The Core Problem Tooling Solves

Front-end tooling didn’t appear because developers enjoy complexity.

It appeared because:

- browsers used to be slower
- assets used to be larger
- workflows didn’t scale
- teams needed repeatability

As the web evolved, **manual workflows stopped being viable**.

Tooling filled that gap.

---

## Pipelines vs Platforms

Historically, front-end tooling focused on **pipelines**:

- take files
- run them through steps
- output optimized assets

Modern tooling focuses on **platforms**:

- run a dev server
- watch files automatically
- reload instantly
- build only when you’re done

This chapter is about that shift.

## How This Chapter Flows

We’ll move through this in order:

1. **The Past**  
   When task runners like Gulp solved real, painful problems.

2. **The Breaking Point**  
   Why pipeline-based tooling stopped scaling.

3. **The Present**  
   How platforms like Vite absorbed those ideas and simplified everything.

This isn’t nostalgia.  
It’s context.

---

## What This Chapter Is _Not_

Let’s be explicit:

- This is **not** a recommendation to use Gulp.
- This is **not** a deep dive into build configuration.
- This is **not** something you’ll be memorizing.

This chapter is about **mental models**.

---

## The Takeaway Goal

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- recognize tooling patterns in any project
- understand _why_ a tool exists
- reason about unfamiliar setups without panic

That’s a professional skill.

## ⏭ Down the Pipe: **The Pre-Build Web**

Before Vite.  
Before dev servers.  
Before hot reload.

Back to a time when the browser wasn’t ready and developers had to compensate.

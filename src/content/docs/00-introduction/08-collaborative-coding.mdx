## **Top 5 Reasons that Collaboration is Critical in Software Dev**

- Idea Exchange: Collaboration brings diverse perspectives, leading to more innovative solutions.
- Efficiency: Dividing tasks among team members speeds up the development process.
- Code Quality: Peer reviews and pair programming can catch errors and improve code structure.
- Learning: Working together helps developers learn new skills and best practices from each other.
- Accountability: Teamwork often leads to higher commitment levels, as no one wants to be the weak link.

Collaboration isn't just a buzzword; it's integral to producing high-quality, maintainable software.

## **In-Class Teamwork Guidelines**

Teamwork is not just encouraged‚Äîit's mandatory for many assignments and most projects in this program.

ü§ù Why? Software dev is a team sport. You'll learn invaluable skills like collaboration, code review, and project management.

For some assignments you'll be choosing your own team.

For other assignments you will be randomly assigned to teams.

You will also have solo assignments.

**Treat team-members as you would treat coworkers.**

Support and encourage them.

Work together. Code together. Learn together. Grow together.

## Conflict Resolution

First and foremost, work it out!

Contacting me to resolve conflicts is the equivalent of complaining to a manager about a coworker.
It should an absolute last resort, in the workplace and in the classroom.

If you really feel something needs escalation to a superior for intervention, let me know and I'll help and/or point you in the right direction.

## Grading:

üìö Though specific assignments may override this, grades received for a team assignment will generally be shared equally among all team members.

**Always check grading notes for specific assignments in the appropriate assignment folder in Learning Hub.**

Let's collaborate, code, create, and learn together!

(AI, used well, is a collaborator too!)

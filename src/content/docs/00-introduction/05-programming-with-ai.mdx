## AI Augmented Dev and Ed

AI in software development is revolutionizing the way we build, test, and deploy code. It automates repetitive tasks, improves code quality, and accelerates the development cycle. Overall, a game-changer for both seasoned devs and newcomers alike.

Tools that produce code are not new.

Prior to the novel suite of AI tools, we has autocomplete utilities (emmet), snippet plugins, and boilerplate templates all of which insert code into your codebase without you typing each character.

AI just does it better, faster, over a broader scope, and in a much more dynamic manner.

#### **Use of Code Generation Tools in Our Class**

üëç Go Ahead, Use Them: I'm all for using these tools to speed up your workflow. They're a part of the real-world dev toolbox, after all.

‚ùó But, Understand Your Code: If you use generated code, make sure you get it. You should be able to explain every line like you wrote it yourself. No "magic code" allowed!

üí° Why?: Understanding the code ensures you're learning and growing as developers, which is what this course is all about.

## AI enrichment:

I encourage you to use generative AI to assist with your assignments, labs, projects, and studies.

I also encourage you to explore how it can serve as a learning tool rather than just a shortcut to completion.

Proper use of AI can deepen your understanding and enrich the learning experience, but it must be done thoughtfully and ethically.

Here are some ideas on how you might use AI effectively and ethically in any assignment:

- Ask AI to explain complex concepts or terms that you find challenging, helping to clarify and solidify your understanding of the material.
- Use AI to guide you step-by-step through a process, ensuring that you grasp each component and how it fits into the larger framework of the task.
- Input the assignment details and ask AI to assist with brainstorming, prompting it to ask you questions that could help structure your ideas or approach to the work.
- Have AI review your work and suggest areas for improvement, ensuring that it meets all requirements.
- Challenge AI to provide creative alternatives or variations on your work, but ensure these remain within the guidelines of the assignment.

## **How NOT to use AI:**

Do not submit any work or code that you do not fully understand. It is essential that you are able to confidently explain all aspects of your submission without the aid of AI.

Relying on AI for solutions without understanding them is both academically dishonest and detrimental to your learning.

Maintaining academic integrity:

If you choose to use AI as a tool in your work, you must be able to unequivocally demonstrate the originality of your submission and defend its academic integrity.

I take this very seriously and need to ensure that your work is free from any suspicion of plagiarism or academic misconduct. You must be prepared to:

- Prove that your work is your own and that AI was used to enhance your learning, not to bypass it.
- Explain, in detail, how AI was used in your process, ensuring that it did not generate content that you do not fully understand or cannot replicate.
- Replicate or closely reproduce your submission if requested, demonstrating a thorough understanding of all components.

## **Documentation requirements for all AI-assisted assignments:**

To protect the integrity of your work, I require that when you use AI, you also:

- Submit the full chat or interaction history as a separate document, showcasing how you utilized AI as part of the assignment process.
- Write a brief summary explaining how AI was employed and how it benefited your learning, without compromising originality.

(Yes, you can use AI to assist in creating the required documentation as well, as long as you follow the above guidelines and maintain the highest standards of academic integrity.)

## Contact Info & Support

#### **Email**

jsolomon11@bcit.ca

You can email me any time. I will always get back to you as soon as (reasonably) possible. On teaching days, and even on (most) weekends, that is usually within a few hours. During breaks and holidays I may take longer to respond, but go ahead and send me email anyways. Email is an asynchronous communication tool - let's use it that way.

#### **Office Hours**

Thursdays, 9:00AM to 2:00PM, via Zoom or Google Meet.

Please email in advance and provide topics to be discussed as well as a link (with access) to relevant git repo.

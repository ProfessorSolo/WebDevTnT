## Introducing Me!

![alt_text](/assets/lessons/josh-intro-card.png 'image_tooltip')

My goal as your instructor is to provide you with the foundational knowledge, tools and techniques needed to fearlessly embark on the long, exciting, sometimes daunting, always rewarding journey towards software development mastery.

I will guide you towards thinking like a programmer as well as how to build applications that not only do what you want them to do, but are also well structured, maintainable, and comprehensible.

Despite my many years of professional experience as a software developer, I am still constantly learning.

Despite occasionally appearing to be a wizard, I am (unfortunately) not one.

I make mistakes. I embrace them. I learn from them.

Though I will spend many hours at the front of the class sharing my knowledge from the podium, I will be by your side throughout this learning adventure.

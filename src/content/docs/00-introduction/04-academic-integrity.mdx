## Academic Integrity

From the BCIT policy on academic integrity:

Academic integrity requires that students do not falsely claim credit for the ideas, writing, or other intellectual property of others, either by presenting such works as their own or through impersonation.

On the surface that is quite clear, and it is the bottom line.

That said, in the world of software development things *can *be murkier.

You will encounter many resources, online and generative, that are overflowing with code examples. At times you will copy and paste (or retype) snippets of that code into your code.

I encourage you to take advantage of all resources available to you.

### **Acceptable Use**

Using code snippets from publicly available online sources for small parts of your assignments/projects is acceptable - if and only if you fully understand the code - and you can confidently say that you would be able to produce that functionality on your own going forward.

_It is courteous to give credit to the original source (as a comment) in your code._

### **Unacceptable Use**

Grabbing templates or large segments of code from the web, changing a few words or values, and claiming it as your own.

### **Review Process**

If I feel that you may have stepped over the line and submitted work that is not authentically yours, the following initial steps will be taken:

1. I'll notify that I have encountered some questionable code in your work.
2. We'll schedule a Zoom meeting to discuss/review.

   1. This meeting will be recorded.
   2. The meeting will be your opportunity to \

      1. Identify sources, if not already properly credited
      2. Demonstrate your mastery of the code in question

### **Next Steps**

Presuming that sufficient mastery has been demonstrated and credit has been given to all sources, no further steps will be necessary.

If not, there may be grading penalties and/or reporting according to BCIT's Academic Integrity processes.

## Opacity and Transparency

### Simple Opacity

Sets the opacity (transparency) of an element as a value between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque).

```css {3}
#opacity div.josh-box {
  width: 100%;
  opacity: 0.6;
  position: relative;
  left: 15%;
  top: 15%;
}
```

### Opacity Inheritance

Opacity applies to the targeted element as well as all all its descendant elements.

```css {3, 11}
#opacity div.josh-box {
  width: 100%;
  opacity: 0.6;
  position: relative;
  left: 15%;
  top: 15%;
}

.red-box,
.blue-box {
  opacity: 1;
  position: absolute;
}
```

Descendant elements cannot override the inherited opacity level of higher up elements towards greater opacity (closer to 1), though they can further decrease the opacity.

### RGBA

The opacity value is also sometimes referred to as the alpha value.

Using the rgba colour space we can specify red, green, and blue values as a range between 0 and 255, and alpha values as a range between 0 and 1.

```css {2,6}
#rgba .red-box {
  background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.6);
}

#rgba .blue-box {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.6);
}
```

### RGBA Deconstructed

RGBA adds an alpha (opacity) channel to the RGB color format.

The alpha channel takes a value between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque).

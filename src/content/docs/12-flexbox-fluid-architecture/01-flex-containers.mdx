## The Architect’s Stage

Before the Architect can guide the line,  
they need a **stage**.

That stage is the **flex container** —  
any element you bless with:

```css
display: flex;
/* or */
display: inline-flex;
```

From that moment on:

- the element becomes a **flex container**
- its **direct children** become **flex items**
- and the normal block/inline rules quietly step aside

No grid yet. No magic ratios.  
Just one decision:

> “This box now controls the flow of its children.”

## 🧱 What Is a Flex Container, Really?

A flex container is a **layout context**.

Inside that context, the Architect gets to choose:

- **direction** of the line (row vs column)
- **wrapping** behavior
- **alignment** along the main and cross axes
- **how items share extra or missing space**

Outside the container, nothing changes.  
Inside, everything obeys Flexbox.

```html
<main class="dashboard">
  <section class="card">One</section>
  <section class="card">Two</section>
  <section class="card">Three</section>
</main>
```

```css
.dashboard {
  display: flex; /* flex container */
  gap: 1.5rem; /* spacing between items */
}

.card {
  padding: 1.5rem;
  background: var(--surface-elevated);
  border-radius: 0.75rem;
}
```

`<main>` is now the Architect’s workbench.  
Each `.card` is a flex item on that stage.

## 🎭 Only Direct Children Join the Cast

Flexbox doesn’t reach down the whole tree.  
It only acts on **direct children** of the container.

```html
<ul class="nav">
  <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="/schedule">Schedule</a></li>
  <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
</ul>
```

```css
.nav {
  display: flex; /* li elements become flex items */
}

.nav li {
  list-style: none;
}

.nav a {
  display: block; /* normal block-level inside each item */
  padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem;
}
```

- `ul.nav` → flex container
- `li` elements → flex items
- the `<a>` tags inside? **Not** flex items.  
  They’re just regular content inside each actor.

If you need _those_ inner elements to flex,  
you give them their **own** `display: flex;` stage.

## 🧭 Container-Only Controls (Preview)

The container owns the big levers:

- `flex-direction` – which way the line runs
- `flex-wrap` – whether items stay on one line or wrap
- `justify-content` – alignment along the **main** axis
- `align-items` – alignment along the **cross** axis
- `align-content` – how multiple lines pack together
- `gap` / `row-gap` / `column-gap` – built-in gutters

We’ll forge each of these in separate chambers.  
For now, your job is simply:

> Pick the element that should control the flow,  
> and **declare it** a flex container.

## 🧪 MiniMo — From Static Stack to Flex Stage

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/12-flexbox-fluid-architecture/01-flex-containers-minimo.html"
  title="From Stack to Flex Stage — Flex Containers"
  height="900px"
/>

Same HTML structure, same children.  
One new rule — `display: flex;` —  
and the entire **behavior** of the layout changes.

That’s the Architect’s power:  
redefine the stage without rewriting the script.

Clone it, tweak the container, break it, fix it.  
Change which element gets `display: flex;` and watch how the cast reacts.

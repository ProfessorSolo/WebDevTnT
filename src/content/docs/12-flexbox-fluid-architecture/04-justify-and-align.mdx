## Places, please.

Flexbox gave us **direction**, then **axes** — now we set the stage for motion.  
**`justify-content`** moves items along the **main axis**.  
**`align-items`** places them along the **cross axis**.  
Simple. Precise. Performative.

## Justify: Move Along the Line

`justify-content` distributes space **along the main axis**.

```css
justify-content: flex-start; /* default */
justify-content: center;
justify-content: flex-end;
justify-content: space-between;
justify-content: space-around;
justify-content: space-evenly;
```

When the main axis changes, `justify-content` follows the flow:  
left/right for rows, top/bottom for columns.

---

## Align: Set the Vertical (or Horizontal) Tone

`align-items` positions items along the **cross axis** — always perpendicular.

```css
align-items: stretch; /* default */
align-items: flex-start;
align-items: center;
align-items: flex-end;
```

Stretch is the quiet default: items fill the cross axis unless told otherwise.

---

## Why This Finally Makes Sense

Because the rule holds:

- **justify** = main axis
- **align** = cross axis

Swap directions, swap axes, keep your sanity.

---

## Centralizing Combo Power Move

```css
place-items: center;
```

On its own, this sets align-items and justify-items to center in one stroke
(albeit only in the cross axis for flexbox, since justify-items doesn’t apply to flex containers).

Even so, the idea endures:
a one-line mental model for “put it smack in the middle.”

---

## When One Item Stands Apart (align-self)

Group alignment is harmonious... until one item wants special treatment.

```css
.child {
  align-self: center;
}
```

align-self overrides align-items for that item alone,
letting a single element rise, sink, or center across the cross axis
without disturbing its neighbors.

This is the first hint that items get their own say,
and it sets the stage for the spatial negotiations coming next.

---

## Next Step: Space Negotiation

With alignment under our belt,
we move into grow, shrink, and basis... How items bargain for space along the main axis,
and who expands, contracts, or holds their ground.

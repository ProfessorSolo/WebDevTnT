## When Visual Order Lies

Flexbox lets us bend what appears **where** without touching the HTML.  
That power runs through a single property: **`order`**.

Used with intention, `order` can:

- Pull a feature card to the front on larger screens
- Tuck secondary content toward the end of a row or column

Used carelessly, it breaks expectations, accessibility, and reading flow.

## The Basics: `order` on Flex Items

Every flex item has an implicit `order: 0`.  
Items are rendered in **source order**, then sorted by `order`:

```css
.line > .card--hero {
  order: -1; /* appears before items with order: 0 */
}

.line > .card--footer {
  order: 10; /* appears after default items */
}
```

Sorting rules:

- Items with **lower order** appear first.
- Items with the **same order** keep their original source order.
- Negative values are allowed; we often use `-1` for “pull forward.”

The DOM stays the same; only the **visual sequence** along the main axis changes.

## Common Patterns (Used Sparingly)

A few scenarios where `order` can help:

- **Promoting a hero card** in a row of content on larger screens
- **Shifting supporting pieces** (like ads or secondary panels) toward the end
- **Altering layout between breakpoints** without duplicating markup

Example:

```css
/* Mobile: natural reading order */
.cards > article {
  order: 0;
}

/* Desktop: hero first, supporting cards after */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .cards > .card--hero {
    order: -1;
  }
}
```

The MiniMo demonstrates exactly this:  
same HTML, different visual order depending on the chosen mode.

## Serious Warnings: Source Order Still Rules

Even when flexbox redraws the stage, **source order remains reality** for:

- Screen readers
- Keyboard navigation
- Copy/paste and text scraping
- SEO and document structure

If the visual order and source order drift too far apart:

- Focus jumps feel “random” when tabbing.
- Screen readers announce content in a different order than we see.
- Students (and future maintainers) get confused by layouts that contradict the DOM.

**Rule of thumb:**

> Reorder small, decorative pieces if we must.  
> Keep primary reading order aligned between **DOM** and **visual layout**.

## Mental Model to Keep

- The DOM defines the **true order**.
- `order` only adjusts the **presentation along the main axis**.
- We prefer to design layouts that **do not rely heavily** on reordering.

In the Flexbox Codex, we will still document a few careful recipes —  
but we will treat `order` as a **precision tool**, not a default layout strategy.

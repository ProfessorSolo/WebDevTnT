## Where Flow Takes Form

_And the Architect reveals the power of the line._

Step closer, apprentice.

Before the blueprints of Grid carved the world into rigid lattices,
the Architect shaped **lines** — streams of content flowing with intention.

Flexbox was their first great tool:
a system for choosing direction, controlling alignment,
and letting elements negotiate their space with grace instead of chaos.

Gone are the days of float hacks, clearfix battles, and vertical-centering rituals.
With Flexbox, the Architect teaches us to **guide the flow**,
not fight it.

## ✨ What We’ll Learn to Shape

- **Flex containers** — The Architect’s workbench where flow begins
- **Flex items** — The actors who obey (or override) the rules of the line
- **Main & cross axis** — The Compass that defines direction and orientation
- **Wrap & flow** — Letting lines break without breaking the layout
- **Grow / shrink / basis** — The laws of spatial negotiation
- **Alignment rituals** — Precision placement along both axes
- **Gaps & gutters** — Clean spacing without margin hacks
- **Ordering, responsibly** — The Architect’s warning about rearranging reality

These are the foundations of **one-dimensional layout mastery**,  
and the stepping stone toward the Architect’s second tool: Grid.

## 🧩 Before We Begin…

In the Architect’s world:

- Every container is a **stage**.
- Every child is a **line-bound actor**.
- Every axis is a **decision about direction**.

With Flexbox, you begin to govern layout at the structural level —
not by guessing, but by **intent**.

By the time you leave this chamber,
you won’t “nudge things around.”
You’ll **guide the line**.

## 🎥 Watch the Flexbox Lesson

Let the Architect walk you through the living mechanics of flow,  
alignment, and proportion.

Seeing the lines reshape in motion will make every concept  
, from axis flips to grow ratios, click into place.

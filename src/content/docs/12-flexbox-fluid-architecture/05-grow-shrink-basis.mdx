## Terms of the Space Deal

Once a container knows its **direction** and **axes**, flex items start negotiating for space.  
Three numbers run the table:

- **`flex-grow`** – how strongly an item asks to grow  
- **`flex-shrink`** – how willing an item is to be squished  
- **`flex-basis`** – the size an item *wants* to start at along the main axis  

Together, they decide who stretches, who holds the line, and who quietly adapts.

## flex-grow: Who Gets Extra Room

When there is **extra space** on the main axis, `flex-grow` decides who claims it.

```css
.track {
  display: flex;
}

.track > .card {
  flex-grow: 1; /* equal shares */
}

.track > .card--hero {
  flex-grow: 3; /* three shares */
}
```

- All grow values are compared as **weights**.  
- `1, 1, 1` → equal slices.  
- `1, 3, 1` → the middle item takes three parts for every one part the others get.

Grow only matters when there is slack to distribute.

---

## flex-shrink: Who Refuses to Be Squished

When there is **not enough space**, `flex-shrink` decides who gives in.

```css
.track {
  display: flex;
}

.track > .card {
  flex-shrink: 1; /* default: can shrink */
}

.track > .card--stubborn {
  flex-shrink: 0; /* holds its width as long as possible */
}
```

Shrink is another weight:

- `1, 1, 1` → all items share the squeeze.  
- `0, 1, 1` → the first item resists; neighbors take more of the hit.

Shrink only matters when the container is too small.

---

## flex-basis: Where Each Item Starts

`flex-basis` sets an item’s **starting size along the main axis**  
(before grow/shrink negotiations adjust it).

```css
.track > .card {
  flex-basis: 10rem; /* start at this width in a row */
}
```

If `flex-basis` is set, it usually overrides `width` along the main axis.  
In a `row`, `basis` behaves like a starting `width`.  
In a `column`, `basis` behaves like a starting `height`.

---

## The Shorthand: `flex`

We rarely write the three properties separately in production:

```css
.card {
  flex: 1 1 12rem;
/*   ↑ ↑  ↑
     | |  └─ flex-basis
     | └──── flex-shrink
     └────── flex-grow */
}
```

Some common patterns:

```css
.card        { flex: 1; }          /* flex: 1 1 0       */
.card--hero  { flex: 2 1 12rem; }  /* grows more, starts wider */
.card--fixed { flex: 0 0 8rem; }   /* no grow, no shrink, fixed basis */
```

The MiniMo above walks through three classic deals:

- equal partners  
- a greedy middle item  
- a stubborn item that refuses to shrink

## Where This Leads

Now that items can negotiate space:

- **Wrap & Flow** will show how those negotiations play out across multiple lines.  
- The **Flexbox Codex** will collect common `flex` recipes for quick reuse.

For now, the rule is simple:

> grow = extra space, shrink = not enough space, basis = starting point along the main axis.

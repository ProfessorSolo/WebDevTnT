## **Alignment Under Wraps**

Once your flex items start wrapping onto multiple lines, a new question shows up:

> “Why did my alignment suddenly stop doing what I expect?”

This chapter is about that moment: **multi-line flexbox** and how `align-content` controls the way **lines** of items are packed in the container.

---

## Single-Line vs Multi-Line Flex

By default, a flex container is **single-line**:

```css
.gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: nowrap; /* default */
}
```

All items are kept on one line along the **main axis**. If they do not fit, they either:

- shrink (`flex-shrink`), or
- overflow the container.

As soon as you enable wrapping:

```css
.gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

you allow items to flow onto **multiple lines**:

- Each line lays out items along the **main axis**.
- The lines themselves stack along the **cross axis**.

That second part is where `align-content` comes in.

---

## The Three Container Alignment Controls

On a flex container, you have three alignment knobs:

- `justify-content` → positions **items along the main axis** (within each line)
- `align-items` → positions **items along the cross axis** (within a line)
- `align-content` → positions **the lines themselves along the cross axis** (multi-line only)

A useful summary:

- `justify-*` → main axis
- `align-*` → cross axis
- `*-items` → individual items
- `*-content` → the group of lines

---

## When `align-content` Has an Effect

`align-content` is not always active. It only does visible work when:

1. The element is a flex container (`display: flex` or `inline-flex`).
2. Wrapping is enabled (`flex-wrap: wrap` or `wrap-reverse`).
3. There is **more than one line** of items.
4. There is **extra space on the cross axis** for those lines to move in.

If any of these are missing, you can set `align-content` to whatever you like and nothing will appear to change.

---

## `align-content` Values (Multi-Line Packing Styles)

The values for `align-content` control how the set of lines is positioned on the cross axis:

- `flex-start` → pack all lines at the **start** of the cross axis
- `flex-end` → pack all lines at the **end** of the cross axis
- `center` → group all lines in the **center**
- `space-between` → first line at start, last at end, others spread out between
- `space-around` → equal space around each line (half-space at container edges)
- `space-evenly` → equal space between every line and the edges
- `stretch` (default) → lines stretch to fill the cross axis (when they can)

In the `.tag-wall` example with `flex-direction: row`:

- Cross axis = vertical
- `align-content: flex-start` → lines hug the top
- `align-content: flex-end` → lines hug the bottom
- `align-content: center` → lines sit as a group in the middle
- `align-content: space-evenly` → lines spread evenly from top to bottom

---

## `justify-content` vs `align-content` in Multi-Line Layouts

With wrapping enabled, layout is a two-layer story:

1. **Within a line**  
   `justify-content` controls how items are distributed along the main axis.

2. **Between lines**  
   `align-content` controls how the lines themselves are distributed along the cross axis.

Example:

```css
.mission-board {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-between; /* items within each row */
  align-content: space-between; /* spacing between the rows */
  gap: 1rem;
  height: 24rem;
  padding: 1.5rem;
}
```

Here:

- Each row of items spreads out horizontally due to `justify-content`.
- The rows themselves are spread vertically due to `align-content`.

Changing one does not change the other.

---

## `align-items` vs `align-content`

Both properties use the word “align”, but they control different things:

- `align-items` → how **items inside each line** sit on the cross axis  
  (for example: top, center, bottom, stretch, baseline)

- `align-content` → how the **set of lines** is positioned on the cross axis  
  (for example: grouped at the top, spaced evenly, stretched)

Example:

```css
.legend {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center; /* vertical alignment of items inside a line */
  align-content: center; /* vertical position of the group of lines */
}
```

If you only have one line, or there is no extra cross-axis space, `align-content` will appear to do nothing. In that case, only `align-items` is visible.

---

## Common Problems to Watch For

When alignment “does not work” with a wrapped flex container, check:

1. Is `display: flex` set on the container?
2. Is `flex-wrap` enabled (`wrap` or `wrap-reverse`)?
3. Do you actually have more than one line of items?
4. Is there any extra space on the axis that property controls?
5. Are `gap` values making it harder to notice the changes?

Try temporarily giving the container a visible outline and fixed height, for example:

```css
outline: 2px dashed hotpink;
height: 18rem;
```

This makes it easier to see where the lines are and how they move when you change alignment values.

## Try It: Multi-Line Alignment Playground

Use the mini-mo below to experiment:

- Toggle wrapping on and off.
- Change `justify-content` to see how items move within each line.
- Change `align-content` to see how the rows as a group move on the cross axis.
- Adjust the container height to exaggerate the effect of `align-content`.

## Summary

- Wrapping turns a single flex line into a **stack of lines**.
- `justify-content` always controls how items are placed on the **main axis**.
- `align-items` controls how items sit on the **cross axis** inside each line.
- `align-content` controls how the **lines** are packed on the **cross axis** when there is:
  - wrapping,
  - more than one line, and
  - extra cross-axis space.

A simple way to remember it:

> **justify the items in a line, align the stack of lines.**

Next, we turn our attention to **gaps** — spacing that finally behaves like it always should have.

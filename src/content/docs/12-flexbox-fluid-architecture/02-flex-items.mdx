## Children of the Container

When a container goes flex, its **direct children** get an instant promotion:  
they become **flex items**. No ceremony. No opt-in.  
Just an entire row of elements suddenly playing by new rules.

## What We Establish Here

A flex _container_ sets the rules.  
Its _items_ follow them.

When we write:

```html
<div class="crew">
  <div class="member">Alpha</div>
  <div class="member">Bravo</div>
  <div class="member">
    Wrapper
    <span class="nested">Nested</span>
  </div>
  <div class="member">Delta</div>
</div>
```

…and activate it:

```css
.crew {
  display: flex;
}
```

We now have:

- A **flex container** (`.crew`)
- Four **flex items** (each direct `.member` child)
- One **nested element** (`.nested`) that is _not_ a flex item

Direct children are in the club. Grandchildren are not.

## How Flex Items Behave Right Now

With no extra flex properties, items:

- Line up in a **row** (the default main axis)
- Sit side-by-side in source order
- Keep their natural size as much as space allows
- Treat nested content as regular inline content inside the item

This is base-level flex behavior.  
No growth rules. No special alignment. No reordering.

---

## Why This Matters

Every upcoming flexbox feature — axes, wrapping, growth, alignment, reordering —  
targets **the items**, not random descendants.

As long as we remember that _only direct children of the container are flex items_,  
the rest of the flexbox story stays far easier to follow.

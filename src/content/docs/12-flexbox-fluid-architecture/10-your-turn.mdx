## Trial by Flex

We have met the properties.  
We have watched the MiniMos dance.

Now it is time to **push pixels on purpose**.

This page is a small arena of **focused flexbox challenges**.  
Each one leans on the concepts from this module and points at the relevant sections of the **Flexbox Codex** for backup.

Use whatever tools help:

- The lessons in this chapter
- The Flexbox MiniMos
- The **99–Flexbox Codex** (once it is live)
- MDN as a safety net

The goal is not to memorize syntax.  
The goal is to build layouts that _feel_ flexbox fluent.

## Challenge 1 — Navigation Row

**Goal:** Build a simple navigation bar that stays tidy across screen sizes.

**HTML starter:**

```html
<nav class="site-nav">
  <a href="#">Home</a>
  <a href="#">Projects</a>
  <a href="#">About</a>
  <a href="#">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

**Requirements:**

- Turn the `nav` into a **flex container**.
- Keep items on one line when there is room.
- Use **`gap`** for spacing between links.
- Center the links on small screens.
- Push them to the right on wider screens.

**Flexbox moves in play:**

- `display: flex`
- `justify-content`
- `gap`
- (Optional) `padding` on the container so the row can breathe.

## Challenge 2 — Direction & Axes Flip

**Goal:** Use **`flex-direction`** and media queries to reflow the same content.

**HTML starter:**

```html
<section class="feature">
  <div class="feature__media">[image]</div>
  <div class="feature__content">
    <h2>Feature Title</h2>
    <p>Short description lives here.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Requirements:**

- Treat `.feature` as a flex container.
- On **mobile**:
  - Stack media **above** content.
- On **desktop**:
  - Place media on the **left**, content on the right.
- Keep spacing consistent with `gap`.

**Flexbox moves in play:**

- `display: flex`
- `flex-direction: column` → `row`
- main vs cross axis from **Direction & Axes**
- `gap`

---

## Challenge 3 — Alignment Arena

**Goal:** Practice **group alignment** vs **single-item alignment**.

**HTML starter:**

```html
<section class="cta-row">
  <p class="cta-row__label">Ready to begin?</p>
  <button class="cta-row__primary">Start now</button>
  <button class="cta-row__ghost">Maybe later</button>
</section>
```

**Requirements:**

- Use flexbox on `.cta-row`.
- On larger screens:
  - Keep all three items on one line.
  - Use `justify-content: space-between` so label hugs the left and buttons hug the right.
- Vertically center everything along the cross axis.
- Make the **“Maybe later”** button drop slightly lower or higher using **`align-self`** so it looks intentionally offset.

**Flexbox moves in play:**

- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `align-self`
- `gap` for spacing between the two buttons

---

## Challenge 4 — Wrap & Gap Gallery

**Goal:** Build a responsive card gallery that wraps cleanly and uses `gap` instead of margin hacks.

**HTML starter:**

```html
<section class="card-gallery">
  <article class="card">One</article>
  <article class="card">Two</article>
  <article class="card">Three</article>
  <article class="card">Four</article>
  <article class="card">Five</article>
  <article class="card">Six</article>
</section>
```

**Requirements:**

- Turn `.card-gallery` into a flex container with **wrapping enabled**.
- Use **`gap`** to create space between cards on both axes.
- On small screens:
  - Cards can fill most of the width (one per row or two per row).
- On medium screens:
  - Aim for two or three cards per row.
- On large screens:
  - Let the gallery breathe, but keep the cards readable (no microscopic heights).

**Flexbox moves in play:**

- `flex-wrap`
- `gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`
- `flex-basis` or `flex` to control card width
- Concepts from **Wrap & Flow** and **Mind the Gap**

## Challenge 5 — Hero with Cautionary Reorder

**Goal:** Use `order` once, deliberately, and call out its trade-offs.

**HTML starter:**

```html
<section class="layout">
  <aside class="layout__side">Sidebar</aside>
  <article class="layout__main">Main content</article>
  <aside class="layout__extra">Extra links</aside>
</section>
```

**Requirements:**

- On mobile:
  - Keep the **DOM order** as the visual order:
    - Sidebar → Main content → Extra links.
- On desktop:
  - Use flexbox so that:
    - Main content appears in the **center**.
    - Sidebar appears on the **left**.
    - Extra links appear on the **right**.
- Use **`order`** to adjust placement _only_ on the desktop layout.

**Flexbox moves in play:**

- `display: flex`
- `flex-direction`
- `order`
- All the warnings from **Reordering Reality** still apply.

At the bottom of your CSS, leave a short comment explaining:

```css
/* Why this reordering is acceptable in this layout
   and how we kept the reading order predictable. */
```

## How to Use These Trials

Pick one:

- As a **solo lab** between concept pages
- As a **pair exercise** where each partner handles different breakpoints
- As a **live-coding walkthrough** with pauses for students to fill in the missing rules

When the Flexbox Codex page is live, each challenge will point to:

- A **recipe name** in the Codex
- A short code snippet with final CSS

For now, the guiding thought:

> We are no longer guessing.  
> We are designing lines, gaps, and flows with intent.

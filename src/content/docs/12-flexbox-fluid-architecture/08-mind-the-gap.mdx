## Space without hacks.

Flexbox spent years paired with awkward margin tricks:  
negative offsets, doubled edges, mysterious extra space.

Modern layout gives us a cleaner option:

- **`gap`** – shared spacing between items on both axes
- **`row-gap`** – spacing between rows
- **`column-gap`** – spacing between columns

No extra wrappers. No weird first/last-child rules. Just honest, structural space.

## gap: Built-In Spacing Between Items

On a flex or grid container, `gap` defines the space **between** items:

```css
.gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

Key details:

- Gap **does not** add space at the outer edges of the container.
- Gap only appears **between siblings**.
- Gap respects wrapping automatically.

This alone replaces a surprising number of margin-based spacing systems.

## row-gap & column-gap

For finer control, `row-gap` and `column-gap` target each axis separately:

```css
.gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  row-gap: 1.5rem; /* between rows (cross axis for a row layout) */
  column-gap: 0.75rem; /* between columns (main axis for a row layout) */
}
```

Remember the axes:

- In a **row** container:

  - `column-gap` → along the main axis (left/right)
  - `row-gap` → along the cross axis (top/bottom)

- In a **column** container:
  - `column-gap` → along the cross axis (left/right)
  - `row-gap` → along the main axis (top/bottom)

The names stay the same, even when the axes rotate.

## Gap vs Margin in a Nutshell

**Margin-based spacing**:

- pushes against neighbors _and_ the container edge
- often needs special rules for the first/last item
- can stack in unexpected ways

**Gap-based spacing**:

- only exists **between** items
- keeps container edges clean
- follows the flex or grid algorithm instead of fighting it

Margins still have a job for components and page edges.  
Gap shines as the spacing system **inside** a flex or grid layout.

## Where This Leads

With `gap` in the toolkit:

- Flex rows and wrapped sets become easier to read and maintain.
- Grid layouts share the same mental model for internal spacing.
- The Flexbox Codex can offer “drop-in spacing recipes” that rely on gap instead of hacks.

Next, we explore how reordering can change what appears where —  
even when the source order in the HTML stays the same.

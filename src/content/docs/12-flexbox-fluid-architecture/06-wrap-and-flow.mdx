## Lines That Bend, Not Break

Flexbox is happiest when layouts **adapt**, not explode.  
Wrapping lets items flow onto new lines instead of forcing scrollbars, overlap, or microscopic text.

`flex-wrap` controls whether we stay on a single line or spill gracefully.  
`flex-flow` bundles **direction** and **wrap** into one neat shorthand.

## flex-wrap: One Line or Many

By default, flex containers try to keep everything on **one line**:

```css
.gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;  /* default */
}
```

The options:

```css
flex-wrap: nowrap;       /* stay on one line; items squeeze */
flex-wrap: wrap;         /* allow new lines in the cross-axis direction */
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse; /* new lines stack from the opposite side */
```

- In a **row**, wrapping creates new rows **below** (or above with `wrap-reverse`).  
- In a **column**, wrapping creates new columns **beside** the original line.

Wrap is the difference between “crammed” and “comfortable.”

## flex-flow: Direction + Wrap in One

We already know **`flex-direction`** picks the main axis.  
`flex-flow` simply pairs that with `flex-wrap`:

```css
/* flex-flow: <flex-direction> <flex-wrap>; */

.gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
}

/* equivalent to */
.gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

This is the combo move we reach for in real projects:

- `row wrap` for responsive rows of cards.  
- `column wrap` for multi-column vertical stacks.

## How Wrap Interacts With Grow, Shrink, Basis

Wrapping does not replace **grow/shrink/basis** — it works with them.

- `flex-grow` still decides who takes **extra** space on each line.  
- `flex-shrink` still decides who yields when a line gets tight.  
- `flex-basis` still sets the starting size along the main axis.

Wrap simply decides:

> “Do we fight to stay on this line, or do we start a new one?”

---

## Mental Model to Keep

- Direction sets the **main axis**.  
- Wrap decides whether there is **only one line** or **many**.  
- Grow/shrink/basis negotiate space **within each line**.

Next, we turn our attention to **gaps** — spacing that finally behaves like it always should have.

## **Know thine axes**

Flexbox doesn’t think in **horizontal** and **vertical** — it thinks in **main axis** and **cross axis**.  
And the single property that defines both is **`flex-direction`**.

## `flex-direction` Sets the Axes

```css
flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: row-reverse;
flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column-reverse;
```

Direction determines:

- how flex items **flow**
- where the **main axis** runs
- where the **cross axis** runs
- how alignment, spacing, and wrapping will behave

Direction is the steering wheel.  
Axes are the roads.

## The Main Axis

The **main axis** is always the direction items move.

- `row` → left → right
- `row-reverse` → right → left
- `column` → top → bottom
- `column-reverse` → bottom → top

Anything that distributes items _along the line_ (like `justify-content`) works on the **main axis**.

---

## The Cross Axis

The **cross axis** is always **perpendicular** to the main axis.

- Row modes → cross axis is **vertical**
- Column modes → cross axis is **horizontal**

Anything that aligns items _across the line_ (like `align-items`) works on the **cross axis**.

---

## The Four Modes

```css
/* Inline direction */
flex-direction: row; /* main: left→right    */
flex-direction: row-reverse; /* main: right→left    */

/* Block direction */
flex-direction: column; /* main: top→bottom    */
flex-direction: column-reverse; /* main: bottom→top */
```

The MiniMo above lets us flip through each mode and watch the axes rotate in real time.

## Why This Matters

Every flexbox power move depends on knowing the axes:

- **justify** = main axis
- **align** = cross axis
- **grow/shrink/basis** size items along the main axis
- wrapping flows along the main axis

Now that our map is clear, we can place items with precision.

Up next: **Justify & Align** — the choreography of each axis.

# 🪄 Calling the Rune  
*Where values answer when their names are spoken.*

Step forward, apprentice.  
The anvils are glowing. The runes hum beneath the floor.  
Here in the **Function Forge**, we stop treating CSS like static decoration  
and begin shaping it as **living arithmetic**.

`var()` is a **summoning spell**, pulling a value into the world —  
with fallbacks, chaining, and reactive strength.

## 🧩 What To Observe

- Each sigil’s glow is **summoned** via `var(--rune-color)`  
- One sigil triggers the **fallback**  
- Hovering swaps invocation sources  
- HTML stays untouched — values do the work

## 📜 The Core Pattern

```css
.rune {
  --rune-color: var(--forge-default, hsl(240 80% 65%));
  background: var(--rune-color);
}
```

`var(--rune-color)` is not a variable.  
It is a **function call** returning a value at runtime.

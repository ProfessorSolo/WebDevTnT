# ⚔️ The Twin Blades of Constraint  
*Choosing the lesser or greater power on demand.*

Sometimes a single value isn’t enough.  
We want elements that:

- grow with the viewport… but **not too huge**  
- shrink on small screens… but **never too tiny**  
- keep a **minimum touch target** while still being responsive

Enter `min()` and `max()`:

- `min(a, b, c)` => **smallest** of the values  
- `max(a, b, c)` => **largest** of the values  

They’re perfect for setting **soft ceilings and floors** on widths, paddings, fonts, and more.

## ✨ MiniMo — The Blade Chamber

Two forged blades sit in the chamber:

- the **Blade of Restraint** uses `min()` to cap its reach,  
- the **Blade of Dominion** uses `max()` to hold a minimum presence.

Resize the frame or hover the controls to see which value wins.

## 🧩 Core Patterns

### 🗡 Blade of Restraint — `min()`

```css
/* Grow with the container, but never exceed 320px */
.blade--restraint {
  width: min(60%, 320px);
}
```

- On wide screens: sticks near **320px**  
- On narrow screens: tracks **60%** of the container

---

### 🗡 Blade of Dominion — `max()`

```css
/* Shrink with the container, but never below 180px */
.blade--dominion {
  width: max(40%, 180px);
}
```

- On roomy layouts: sits near **40%**  
- On cramped layouts: refuses to go below **180px**

---

## 🧮 Common Use Cases

- Constraining **cards** or **content columns**  
  ```css
  .card {
    width: min(100%, 420px);
  }
  ```

- Keeping **controls tappable**  
  ```css
  .spell-button {
    inline-size: max(10ch, 160px);
  }
  ```

- Combining with `var()` for tunable design tokens  
  ```css
  .pane {
    width: min(100%, var(--pane-max, 720px));
  }
  ```

`min()` and `max()` don’t replace `clamp()` —  
they’re the **simpler blades** you reach for when you only need  
one side of the constraint.

Next in the forge: combining both ends at once with **`clamp()`**.

## Repeat Yourself — But In CSS

Writing this is fine… once:

```css
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
```

Writing it all semester is not.

`repeat()` lets you define track patterns cleanly — and scale them without rewriting your template every time.

---

## The Syntax

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
```

That means:

- Make **4** columns
- Each column is **1fr**

Same result. Less noise.

---

## Change the Count, Keep the Pattern

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
```

You didn’t rewrite the track list — you changed the count.

That’s the whole point.

---

## Repeat Works for Rows Too

```css
grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 10rem);
```

Any track size works: `fr`, `rem`, `%`, `minmax()`, etc.

Long templates are a smell.  
Patterns are power.

## The Takeaway

Use `repeat()` when:

- Your grid has repeated structure
- You want to scale column/row counts quickly
- You want templates that stay readable under pressure

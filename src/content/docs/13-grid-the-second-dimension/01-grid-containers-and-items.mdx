## The Contract That Makes Grid Work

Grid is powerful — but it is also strict.

Nothing happens until the **parent–child relationship** is established.

---

## The Grid Container

A grid layout begins the moment you declare a container:

```css
.layout {
  display: grid;
}
```

That single line does two things:

- It turns the element into a **grid container**
- It gives its **direct children** the potential to become grid items

Unlike Flexbox, Grid does _nothing visible_ yet.

No columns.  
No rows.  
No layout.

Just intent.

---

## Grid Items

Only **direct children** of a grid container participate in the grid.

```html
<main class="layout">
  <article>Grid Item</article>
  <article>Grid Item</article>
  <article>Grid Item</article>
</main>
```

- Each `<article>` is a **grid item**
- Nested elements inside them are _not_ grid items
- Grid never skips levels

This rule is absolute — and essential.

---

## Parent Drives Layout

In Grid, the **container defines structure**.

The items respond.

You do **not**:

- Size grid items directly to form layout
- Push items around with margins and positioning
- Let content decide the page structure

Instead, you:

- Define rows and columns on the container
- Then place items into that structure

Grid is layout-first CSS.

---

## A Key Difference from Flexbox

Flexbox reacts to content.

Grid imposes structure.

Flexbox asks:

> “How should these items flow?”

Grid asks:

> “What does the layout look like?”

That distinction will guide every decision you make.

## 🧪 MiniMo — The Invisible Grid

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/13-grid-the-second-dimension/01-grid-containers-and-items.html"
  title="The Invisible Grid — Intent Without Tracks"
  height="420px"
/>

Same HTML structure, same children.  
One new rule — `display: grid;` —

…and basically nothing changes.

Grid stays invisible until we define tracks.  
That’s not a bug — it’s the design.

---

## Nothing Happens Until We Define Tracks

This often surprises people:

```css
.layout {
  display: grid;
}
```

Produces… nothing.

Why?

Because Grid requires **tracks**:

- Columns
- Rows
- Or both

Until those exist, the browser has no layout to apply.

That’s not a bug.  
That’s design.

---

## The Takeaway

Before anything else in Grid:

- Define the container
- Understand the parent–child boundary
- Accept that layout lives on the parent

Everything else builds on this contract.

Break it, and Grid won’t negotiate.

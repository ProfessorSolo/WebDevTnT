## Grid All the Way Down

Real layouts aren’t one grid.

They’re **layers of grids**:

- page-level grid (header / sidebar / content)
- section-level grid (cards, tiles, galleries)
- component grid (icon + text + actions)

The rule is simple:

A **grid item** can also be a **grid container**.

## The Pattern

Outer grid defines the big structure.

Inner grid defines the structure _inside a region_.

```css
.page {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 14rem 1fr;
  grid-template-areas:
    'header  header'
    'sidebar content';
}

.content {
  grid-area: content;
  display: grid; /* nested grid */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

No magic.

Just composition.

## Common Student Mistake

They try to make one grid do everything.

That’s how you get:

- unreadable templates
- brittle placement rules
- layouts that explode on resize

Nested grids keep each layer clean.

## 🧪 MiniMo — Nested Grid Switchboard

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/13-grid-the-second-dimension/11-nested-grids-minimo.html"
  title="Nested Grids — Switchboard"
  height="800px"
/>

Turn the nested grid on/off.  
Change inner columns.  
Watch the outer layout stay stable.

---

## The Takeaway

Grid is a system, not a single layout.

Build big structure first.  
Then grid the inside.

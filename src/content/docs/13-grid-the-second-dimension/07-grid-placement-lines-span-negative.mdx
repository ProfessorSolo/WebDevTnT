## Manual Placement Begins

Auto-placement is polite.

This is where you stop being polite.

Grid placement is **line-based**:

- Lines start at **1**
- You choose **start / end** or **start / span**
- Anything not placed stays in auto-flow

---

## Two Placement Styles

### Start / End (Line-Based)

```css
grid-column: 1 / 3;
grid-row: 2 / 4;
```

### Start / Span (Distance-Based)

```css
grid-column: 2 / span 2;
grid-row: 1 / span 3;
```

Same power. Different mental model.

---

## Negative Lines: Anchoring from the Edge

Grid lines also count **backward**.

- `-1` → last line
- `-2` → second-to-last

```css
grid-column: -3 / -1;
```

You don’t need to know how many columns exist.  
You just aim for the edge.

## The Takeaway

Auto-placement is convenience.

Placement is intent.

Negative lines make that intent **resilient**.

Named spaces are easier to work with than edge lines.

## Same HTML. New Blueprint.

Named areas are already readable.

Responsive areas are where Grid becomes unfair.

You can **rebuild the entire page layout** at different breakpoints without touching your HTML.

---

## The Pattern

1. Define the desktop blueprint
2. Override the blueprint in a media query

```css
.layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 14rem 1fr;
  grid-template-areas:
    'header  header'
    'sidebar content'
    'footer  footer';
}

@media (max-width: 48rem) {
  .layout {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    grid-template-areas:
      'header'
      'content'
      'sidebar'
      'footer';
  }
}
```

This is the secret sauce:

- same elements
- same `grid-area` names
- different map

---

## Why This Beats “Reordering the DOM”

- Your HTML stays semantic
- Accessibility stays sane
- Layout becomes a CSS-only concern

## 🧪 MiniMo — Responsive Blueprint Switcher

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/13-grid-the-second-dimension/09-responsive-areas-minimo.html"
  title="Responsive Blueprint Switcher"
  height="700px"
/>

Toggle between desktop, tablet, and mobile blueprints.  
Notice: no HTML changes.

## The Takeaway

Grid areas aren’t just readable.

They’re refactorable.

That’s the difference between “layout” and “layout system.”

## ⏭ Up Ahead: **Alignment and Spacing**

How are items aligned within an area and how are the spaces between defined.

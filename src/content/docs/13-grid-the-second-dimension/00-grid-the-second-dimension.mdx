## I got in.

Flexbox fixed alignment.  
Grid fixes **layout**.

One dimension only gets us so far.
Pages are two-dimensional.

Enter the Grid.

## Life Before Grid

Before Grid, full page layouts were… improvised.

We built them by:

- Nesting flex rows inside flex columns
- Clearing floats
- Faking columns with percentages
- Wrestling footers into place
- Explaining to students why the code _looked nothing like the design_

It worked.  
But it was fragile, verbose, and exhausting to reason about.

---

## Flexbox Was Necessary — But Not Sufficient

Flexbox gave us powerful control along **one axis at a time**.

That made it incredible for:

- Navigation bars
- Toolbars
- Cards
- Components

But pages don’t live on one axis.

They live on **rows and columns simultaneously**.

---

## Enter the Second Dimension

CSS Grid is a **two-dimensional layout system**.

You define:

- Columns
- Rows
- Gaps
- Structure

Then you place content _into_ that structure.

Not the other way around.

---

## The Mental Shift

Grid changes how you think.

You stop thinking in terms of:

- left / right
- top / bottom

And start thinking in terms of:

- **grid lines**
- **tracks**
- **areas**

You design the layout first.  
Then you assign content to it.

That’s the second dimension.

---

## What Grid Makes Possible

With Grid, you can:

- Build full-page layouts cleanly
- Span elements across rows _and_ columns
- Rearrange layouts visually without touching HTML
- Redefine structure at breakpoints
- Layer and overlap elements intentionally

No floats.  
No hacks.  
No duct tape.

---

## Grid and Flexbox Are Teammates

This isn’t Flexbox _vs_ Grid.

It’s:

- **Grid for layout**
- **Flexbox for components**

When you use both intentionally, layout becomes predictable, expressive, and sane.

And that’s where the real fun starts.

### 🧱 Grid: The Second Dimension Demo Lab — _Coming Soon_

Every demonstration used in this module — explicit tracks, implicit flow, line placement, template areas, responsive rewrites, and layering — will live inside the **Grid: The Second Dimension Demo Lab**.

### Clone locally to explore the architect’s workshop _(soon)_

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProfessorSolo/WebDevTnT-Enter-The-Grid.git
```

Experiment freely — redraw tracks, reassign areas, collapse layouts, and watch the structure adapt.  
Grid rewards _planning_.

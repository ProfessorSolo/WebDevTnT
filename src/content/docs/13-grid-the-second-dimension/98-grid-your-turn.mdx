## Your Turn, Architect

You’ve seen the spells.

Now you cast them.

This page is a set of **practice missions**.  
No hand-holding. No perfect answers. Just real layout reps.

---

## Mission Rules

- Work in a sandbox (CodePen / local file / your Grid demo repo)
- Use **Grid first** — then optionally “enhance” with Flexbox inside components
- Keep your HTML semantic (header, nav, main, aside, footer, section, article)
- Prefer `gap` over margins for grid spacing

---

## Quest 1 — The Blueprint (Areas)

Build a page layout using **named areas**:

- header
- sidebar
- content
- footer

Requirements:
- Use `grid-template-areas`
- Assign areas with `grid-area`
- Use `gap`

Stretch goal:
- Add a hero overlay using **overlap** (same grid cells, different layers)

---

## Quest 2 — The Rewire (Responsive Areas)

Without changing HTML:

- Desktop: sidebar beside content
- Mobile: sidebar moves below content

Requirements:
- Use a media query
- Only change `grid-template-areas` (and tracks if needed)

Stretch goal:
- Add a “tablet” blueprint that differs from both desktop and mobile

---

## Quest 3 — The Tile Field (Explicit + Implicit)

Create a tile section of **at least 12 cards**.

Requirements:
- Use `repeat()` and `fr`
- Demonstrate the **implicit grid** (enough tiles to force auto-created rows)
- Use `gap`

Stretch goal:
- Use `grid-auto-flow: row dense` and observe what changes (and what doesn’t)

---

## Quest 4 — Manual Placement (Lines, Span, Negatives)

Place at least **three** items manually.

Requirements:
- One item placed with start/end lines
- One item placed with start/span
- One item anchored with **negative lines** (e.g. `-3 / -1`)

Stretch goal:
- Rebuild the same layout *two different ways* (lines vs areas)

---

## Quest 5 — Nested Grid (Composition)

Inside your content area, create a nested grid:

- outer grid = page layout
- inner grid = card layout

Requirements:
- The inner grid changes columns at a breakpoint
- The outer grid stays stable

Stretch goal:
- Give one card its own mini grid (icon + text + actions)

---

## Self‑Check (No Excuses)

Before you call it “done”, confirm:

- [ ] You can explain **tracks** vs **cells** vs **lines**
- [ ] You can use **areas** without guessing
- [ ] You can rewire layout at breakpoints **without touching HTML**
- [ ] You can place items with **lines/span** (and anchor with negatives)
- [ ] You can nest grids without turning your CSS into spaghetti

---

## What to Submit

If your course workflow requires a submission, include:

- a screenshot of desktop layout
- a screenshot of mobile layout
- your HTML + CSS (and any notes about what you learned)

## Grid Has a Z‑Axis

Most people think Grid is rows and columns.

It’s also **layers**.

Multiple grid items can occupy the same cells — and that’s not a mistake.  
That’s how you build:

- hero overlays
- badges
- callouts
- stacked UI panels

---

## The Core Idea

Two or more items can share the same grid area.

```css
.hero {
  display: grid;
}

.hero img {
  grid-area: 1 / 1;
}

.hero .overlay {
  grid-area: 1 / 1;
}
```

Same cells. Different layers.

---

## Controlling the Stack

Grid doesn’t invent stacking rules — it uses normal CSS stacking.

```css
.overlay {
  z-index: 2;
}
```

Positioning is optional.  
Grid items stack naturally when they overlap.

---

## Common Pitfall

Students reach for `position: absolute`.

That works — but you lose:

- intrinsic sizing
- grid alignment
- responsive flow

Grid overlap keeps everything _in the layout system_.

## 🧪 MiniMo — Overlap Playground

<MiniMo

  height="680px"
/>

Toggle overlap.  
Raise layers.  
See how grid stays intact.

---

## The Takeaway

Grid isn’t just structure.

It’s controlled chaos — with rules.

It's not a competition. Grid and Flex work together.

## Space Is a First-Class Citizen

Grid doesn’t just place items — it manages **space**.

There are two different alignment stories:

- how items align **inside their cells**
- how the grid aligns **inside its container**

And one universal spacer: `gap`.

---

## Gaps Are Not Margins

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
gap: 1rem;
```

`gap`:

- works in both directions
- doesn’t collapse
- doesn’t leak outside the grid

Use it. Love it.

---

## Aligning Items (Inside Cells)

These affect how items sit **within their grid areas**:

- `align-items` (block axis)
- `justify-items` (inline axis)

```css
align-items: center;
justify-items: stretch;
```

---

## Aligning the Grid Itself

These affect how the **entire grid** is packed inside the container:

- `align-content`
- `justify-content`

They only matter when there’s extra space.

## 🧪 MiniMo — Alignment Lab

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/13-grid-the-second-dimension/10-grid-alignment-minimo.html"
  title="Alignment Lab — Gaps & Alignment"
  height="780px"
/>

Change gaps.  
Shift items.  
Watch space move.

## The Takeaway

Grid gives you control over:

- placement
- spacing
- alignment

Once you see the difference, the properties stop feeling redundant.

## The Architect’s Battle

Flexbox and Grid are not rivals.  
They’re specialists.

- **Flexbox**: one-dimensional flow (row *or* column)
- **Grid**: two-dimensional layout (rows *and* columns)

If you pick the right tool, your CSS gets smaller.  
If you pick the wrong one, you start wrestling the browser… and losing.

## The Quick Rule

### Use **Flexbox** when…
- you’re laying out items along **one axis**
- you want **content-driven sizing**
- you’re aligning/spacing a row of UI controls

Examples:
- nav bars
- button rows
- card headers (icon + text + actions)
- “center this thing” (yes, still)

---

### Use **Grid** when…
- you need **both axes**
- you want **explicit structure**
- you want layout that can **rewire at breakpoints**

Examples:
- page layouts (header / sidebar / content / footer)
- galleries, dashboards, tiles
- responsive “areas” layouts
- overlap / layering

---

## Use Both (The Real Move)

Common pro pattern:

- Grid for the **page-level skeleton**
- Flexbox for **components** inside each region

Grid builds the building.  
Flexbox arranges the furniture.

## The Takeaway

You don’t “graduate” from Flexbox to Grid.

You collect tools.  
Then you build better systems.

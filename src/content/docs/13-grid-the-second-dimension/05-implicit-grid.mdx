## The Grid You Didn’t Ask For

You define an explicit grid.

Then you add more items than it can hold.

Grid doesn’t panic — it quietly creates _more grid_.

That extra structure is the **implicit grid**.

---

## Explicit vs Implicit

- **Explicit grid**: tracks you define with `grid-template-*`
- **Implicit grid**: tracks created automatically when items overflow

Example:

- You define 3 columns
- You place 12 items
- Grid creates as many rows as needed to fit them

---

## Auto-Placement: The Default Flow

If you don’t place items manually, Grid auto-places them:

- left to right
- then wraps to the next row

That’s why it feels like “a smarter inline-block system”.

---

## Control Implicit Track Sizing

By default, implicit rows are `auto` height.

You can control this using `grid-auto-rows`:

```css
.layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 10rem;
}
```

Now every implicit row gets a consistent height.

---

## Implicit Columns Exist Too

If your auto-placement flow is column-based, Grid can create implicit **columns** as well.

We’ll keep that one holstered for later, but it’s the same idea:
`grid-auto-columns`.

---

## 🧪 MiniMo — Overflow Summons the Implicit Grid

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/13-grid-the-second-dimension/05-implicit-grid-minimo.html"
  title="Overflow Summons the Implicit Grid"
  height="780px"
/>

Define a small explicit grid.  
Add too many items.  
Watch the implicit grid appear.

---

## The Takeaway

Grid always has two layers:

- The structure you define
- The structure it creates

Learn both, and auto-placement stops being “mysterious”.

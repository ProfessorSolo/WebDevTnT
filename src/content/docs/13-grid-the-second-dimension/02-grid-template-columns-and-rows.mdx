## The Moment Grid Becomes Visible

On the last page, `display: grid;` was pure intent.

This is where Grid finally **shows up**.

When you define **tracks** (columns and/or rows), you create the **explicit grid** — and the browser has a structure to apply.

---

## Define Columns with `grid-template-columns`

You can specify as many columns as you want, using any valid length units:

```css
.layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 240px 240px 240px 240px;
}
```

Once columns exist, grid items begin flowing into the cells automatically — left to right, top to bottom.

---

## Define Rows with `grid-template-rows`

Rows work the same way:

```css
.layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 10rem 10rem;
}
```

If you define fewer rows than you have items for, Grid will create more rows as needed (that’s the **implicit grid**, coming soon).

---

## Tracks, Lines, Cells (Quick Vocabulary)

- **Tracks**: the columns and rows you define
- **Lines**: the boundaries between tracks (they start at **1**, not 0)
- **Cells**: the rectangles formed by intersecting tracks

Grid is basically: _lines first, placement second._

## 🧪 MiniMo — Make the Grid Appear

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/13-grid-the-second-dimension/02-grid-template-cols-and-rows-minimo.html"
  title="Tracks Online — Grid Template Columns & Rows"
  height="820px"
/>

Same HTML. New rules.  
Define tracks — and the grid snaps into existence.

---

## The Takeaway

If you want Grid to _do_ something:

1. Set the container: `display: grid;`
2. Define tracks: `grid-template-columns` and/or `grid-template-rows`

No tracks, no grid.

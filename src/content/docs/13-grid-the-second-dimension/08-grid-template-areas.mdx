## Blueprints, Not Coordinates

Line numbers are precise.

But they can also get… gross.

Named areas let you design a layout like a map:

- header
- sidebar
- content
- footer

That’s what `grid-template-areas` is for: readable layout intent.

---

## Define Areas on the Container

```css
.layout{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 14rem 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;

  grid-template-areas:
    "header  header"
    "sidebar content"
    "footer  footer";
}
```

The strings describe the grid.

---

## Assign Items to Areas

```css
header  { grid-area: header; }
aside   { grid-area: sidebar; }
main    { grid-area: content; }
footer  { grid-area: footer; }
```

Now your HTML can stay semantic, and the grid does the layout work.

---

## Dots Mean “Empty”

You can leave cells unused with `.`

```css
grid-template-areas:
  "header header"
  ".      content"
  "footer footer";
```

## 🧪 MiniMo — Area Architect

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/13-grid-the-second-dimension/08-grid-areas-minimo.html"
  title="Area Architect — grid-template-areas"
  height="980px"
/>

Swap blueprints.  
Watch the layout rewire itself.

## The Takeaway

Areas are the readable option:

- great for page layout
- easy to refactor
- less fragile than line-number spaghetti

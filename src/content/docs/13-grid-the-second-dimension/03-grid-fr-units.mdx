## The Unit That Makes Grid Feel Alive

Pixel columns are rigid.  
Percent columns are fragile.

`fr` is Grid’s native power move: divide the remaining space into fractions.

---

## What `fr` Means

`fr` stands for **fraction of the available space** inside the grid container.

---

## Unequal Fractions

Fractions don’t need to be equal.

---

## Mixing Fixed + fr

Fixed sizes are calculated first.  
Then the remainder becomes fraction territory.

Fractions adapt.

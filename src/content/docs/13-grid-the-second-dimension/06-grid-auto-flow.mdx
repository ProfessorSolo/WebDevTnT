## How Grid Decides What Goes Where

When you don’t explicitly place items, Grid makes choices.

Those choices are governed by **auto-placement** — specifically `grid-auto-flow`.

This is the rulebook Grid uses to fill the grid.

---

## The Default: Row Flow

```css
grid-auto-flow: row;
```

This is the default behavior:

- Fill rows left to right
- Then create new rows as needed

It feels familiar — but it’s still Grid, not Flexbox.

---

## Column Flow Changes Everything

```css
grid-auto-flow: column;
```

Now Grid:

- Fills top to bottom
- Then creates new columns

Same items.  
Same grid.  
Very different outcome.

---

## Dense Packing (Use Carefully)

```css
grid-auto-flow: row dense;
```

`dense` tells Grid to backfill gaps when possible.

This can:
- Reduce empty space
- Reorder items visually

Powerful — but potentially confusing if overused.

## 🧪 MiniMo — Auto-Flow Control Room

<MiniMo

  title="Auto-Flow Control Room"
  height="980px"
/>

Change the flow direction.  
Add gaps.  
Watch Grid rethink placement.

## The Takeaway

Auto-placement is predictable — once you know the rules.

Control the flow,  
or Grid will happily choose for you.

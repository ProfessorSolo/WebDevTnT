# **How we floe from here to there**

Time to fire up the control panel, class.

These four pieces — **property**, **duration**, **timing**, and **delay** — are the entire transition engine.

Everything else builds from here.

## 🎛 The Four Parts of a Transition

### 1. **Property**

What is allowed to interpolate?

```css
transition-property: transform;
```

You can target one property, multiple, or `all` (but we’ll talk about why “all” is spicy later).

---

### 2. **Duration**

How long the ride takes.

```css
transition-duration: 300ms;
```

Short durations feel snappy.  
Long durations feel cinematic (or sluggish — use wisely).

---

### 3. **Timing Function**

How the motion _feels_ — linear, snappy, bouncy, chill.

```css
transition-timing-function: ease-out;
```

We go deep on timing functions in the next chapters.

---

### 4. **Delay**

How long must we wait before the action begins.

```css
transition-delay: 0.1s;
```

Used sparingly, delay can make interactions feel intentional.  
Used poorly, it feels like laggy lag lag lag.  
Use delay _VERY_ intentionally.

---

## 🧩 Shorthand (Most Common Form)

```css
transition: transform 300ms ease-out 0s;
```

Property → Duration → Timing → Delay.  
Clean, compact, predictable.

## 🧲 Hover + Transition = Basic Motion

```css
.ps--space-wabbit {
  width: 26%;
  transform: translateY(100px) scale(1);
  transition: transform 500ms ease-out;
}

.ps--space-wabbit:hover .ps-space-wabbit {
  transform: translateY(-500px) scale(3);
}
```

This is the “UI feels alive” effect, taken to an epic Professor Solo extreme — powerful, BIG fun.

<style is:global>{`
.ps-bunny-stage {
  position: relative;
  width: min(100%, 28rem);
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
  margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}

.ps-bunny {
  width: 26%;
  transform: translateY(100px) scale(1);
  transition: transform 500ms ease-out;
}

.ps-bunny-stage:hover .ps-bunny {
  transform: translateY(-500px) scale(3);
}
`}</style>

## Bunny Hop (Hover)

<div class="ps-bunny-stage" aria-label="Bunny hopping on hover">
  <img
    class="ps-bunny"
    src="/assets/lessons/m5-space-bunny-256w.webp"
    alt="Space bunny hopping upward on hover."
  />
</div>

## The Arcane Ledger

You’ve now learned how to wield **CSS custom properties** like a spellcaster:

- Declare named runes (variables) with `--token-name`
- Summon their power using `var()`
- Scope them globally, by circle (section), or inside a single glyph (component)
- Hand the wand to JavaScript to rewrite runes at runtime
- Use variables as **intensity dials** for motion, glow, lift, duration, and theme

You’re officially ready to build interfaces that feel **enchanted**, not hard-coded.

## 🔮 Your Wizard’s Laboratory — Demo Repo

Every spell in this module lives inside the Wizard Lab — the evolving workshop where tokens glow, themes shift, and entire interfaces bow to a single variable.

If you want to _feel_ variable-driven design rather than just read about it, dive into the repo and start tweaking the runes yourself. Change one token. Watch the world adjust.

> **Demo Repo:**

```bash
# Clone this spell-lab locally
git clone https://github.com/ProfessorSolo/WebDevTnT-CSS-Variable-Wizardry.git
```

This demo includes four enchanted chambers:

1. **The Ingredient Chamber** — global tokens & variable basics
2. **The Circle of Scopes** — how runes change meaning depending on where they’re cast
3. **The Wand Room** — JS rewriting tokens in real time
4. **The Sigil of Motion** — performance-safe hover magic driven by variables

Bookmark the repo — this is your spell practice dojo for the entire module.

## 🎥 Lesson Video — Variable Wizardry in Action

Seeing variables cascade, override, and merge in real time makes the whole system click — it's the difference between reading a spell and watching it spark.

Watching the tokens shift live gives you the intuition the docs can’t.  
Once you’ve seen the magic unfold, the Wizard Lab becomes pure playground.

## 🧪 Guided Experiments in the Wizard Lab

When exploring the Wizardry Demo, try these quests:

### **1. Ingredient Chamber — Rune Basics**

- Modify global runes like:
  - `--arcane-accent`
  - `--page-bg`
  - `--glyph-border`
- Add your own rune (e.g. `--label-bg`) and use it behind glyph titles.
- Inspect how many UI elements pull from a single rune change.

### **2. Circle of Scopes — Power Boundaries**

- Identify runes declared in:
  - The **root grimoire** (`:root`)
  - A **circle glyph** wrapper
  - A single **spell-card**
- Override a rune at each level and observe who inherits the new meaning.
- Practice tracing scope using DevTools → Computed → “Show all CSS variables”.

### **3. Wand Room — JavaScript Tokenbinding**

- Add a new ritual button (`data-theme="astral"` or `data-theme="emberforge"`).
- Declare one new rune (e.g. `--card-ring-color`) and update it per ritual.
- Log each rune change using:
  ```js
  getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--rune');
  ```

### **4. Sigil of Motion — Performance Glyphs**

- Confirm hover interactions use only:
  - `transform`
  - `opacity`
  - `box-shadow`
- Experiment with:
  - `--lift-distance`
  - `--shadow-strength`
  - `--transition-ms`
- Crank values too high, then refine — learn the finesse of subtle magic.

## 🎯 Practice Quests for the Aspiring Archmage

### **Level 1 — Rune Cleanup**

- Find repeated literal values in the demo (colors, radii, spacing).
- Promote them to runes in `:root`.
- Replace their usages with `var(--your-rune)`.

### **Level 2 — Alternate Circle**

- Create a new themed circle (e.g. “Moonlit Sanctum” or “Infernal Atrium”).
- Override at least three runes inside that wrapper.
- Confirm components inherit without any HTML changes.

### **Level 3 — Ritual Enhancement**

- Extend the Wand Room with:
  - A live rune readout panel
  - A slider or input that updates a numeric rune (`--glow-intensity`, `--blur-strength`)
  - A toggle that flips between two rune sets using one wrapper class

## 🤖 AI Training Grounds (Copy / Paste This Spell)

```prompt
Act as my CSS Variable Wizardry trainer.

Using the concepts from the module:
- Declaring & using CSS custom properties
- Scoping variables globally, by section, and per-component
- Updating variables at runtime with JavaScript
- Driving motion, shadows, and timing from variable intensity dials

Create an interactive “Wizard’s Lab” playground with:

1. Global runes declared in :root for color, radius, glow, shadow, and timing.
2. A section wrapper (“circle”) that overrides at least two runes.
3. A spell-card component that:
   - Has component-level default runes
   - Inherits overrides from its circle or the root
4. A JavaScript Wand Panel with buttons or a select menu that:
   - Changes runes in real time using setProperty()
   - Displays a live readout of at least 3 rune values
5. All hover magic must use transform + opacity (no layout animation).

Output:
- A single HTML file with inline CSS + JS
- Clear comments
- No external libraries
```

## ➡️ New Paths

With variables thoroughly in your spellbook:

- **Selector Spells** will sharpen your aim
- **Function Forge** will help you combine runes with `calc()`, gradients, and color functions
- **Arcane Animations** later will flow naturally once your values live in tokens

For now, keep asking:

> **“Should this be a rune?”**  
> If you use it more than once, the answer is: _yes, apprentice._

## What This Page Is

This page is a **reference**, not a lesson.

It exists to:
- jog memory
- clarify syntax
- reinforce intent
- support decision-making

If something here feels unfamiliar, the earlier pages explain *why* it exists.

---

## Core Syntax

### Variables

```scss
$primary: #3366ff;
$spacing: 1rem;
```

Compile-time only. Replaced with literal values in output.

---

### Nesting

```scss
.card {
  h2 {
    margin-top: 0;
  }
}
```

Use for structural relationships. Keep nesting shallow.

---

### Parent Selector (`&`)

```scss
.button {
  &:hover {
    background-color: darkblue;
  }
}
```

Expands to the full selector at compile time.

---

## File Composition

### Partials

```text
_base.scss
_layout.scss
_components.scss
```

- Not compiled directly
- Pulled into an entry file
- Used for organization

---

### Entry File

```scss
// main.scss
@use 'base';
@use 'layout';
@use 'components';
```

One compilation target. Everything else supports it.

---

## Reuse Patterns

### Placeholders + `@extend`

```scss
%card-base {
  padding: 1rem;
}

.card {
  @extend %card-base;
}
```

- Merges selectors
- Best for shared meaning
- Avoid nested or state-based extends

---

### Mixins

```scss
@mixin elevated {
  box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1.25rem rgba(0,0,0,0.25);
}

.card {
  @include elevated;
}
```

- Copies declarations
- Good for configurable or state-based reuse

---

### Functions

```scss
@function space($step) {
  @return $step * 0.5rem;
}
```

- Returns values
- No CSS emitted directly
- Ideal for scales and derived values

---

## Logic and Generation

### Conditionals

```scss
@if $mode == compact {
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
```

- Compile-time only
- Keep option sets small and deliberate

---

### Loops

```scss
@for $i from 1 through 4 {
  .gap-#{$i} {
    gap: $i * 0.5rem;
  }
}
```

- Use for bounded, predictable output
- Avoid large or hidden expansions

---

### Lists

```scss
$states: (success, warning, danger);
```

Ordered values. Use when names alone are enough.

---

### Maps

```scss
$gaps: (
  sm: 0.5rem,
  md: 1rem,
  lg: 1.5rem
);
```

Key/value pairs. Use when intent and naming matter.

---

## Sass vs CSS Variables

### Sass Variables

- compile-time
- lexical scope
- not visible to the browser

### CSS Custom Properties

- runtime
- cascade-aware
- adjustable via classes, media queries, JS

---

## Common Pairing Pattern

```scss
$tokens: (
  primary: #3366ff,
  surface: #ffffff
);

:root {
  @each $name, $value in $tokens {
    --#{$name}: #{$value};
  }
}
```

Sass authors the system. CSS variables enable runtime flexibility.

---

## Decision Reminders

Ask these before adding Sass features:

- Is this solving real repetition?
- Does this improve clarity?
- Will the output be predictable?
- Would plain CSS be simpler?

If the answer is unclear, don’t abstract yet.

---

## Final Thought

Sass is most effective when it:
- reduces cognitive load
- makes intent explicit
- stays out of the browser’s way

Use it deliberately.

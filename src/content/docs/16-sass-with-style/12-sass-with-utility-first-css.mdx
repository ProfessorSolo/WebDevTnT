## Why This Combination Comes Up

In modern projects, Sass and utility-first CSS often appear together.

This can feel redundant at first:
- Sass already generates CSS
- utility classes already encode design decisions

The key is understanding that they solve *different* problems.

---

## Different Responsibilities

Utility-first CSS focuses on:
- composition at the markup level
- consistent application of spacing, color, and layout
- rapid iteration without writing new selectors

Sass focuses on:
- authoring structure
- data and generation
- compile-time decision making

Used together, Sass supports the system, while utilities express intent in the HTML.

---

## What We Do *Not* Use Sass For

When using a utility-first approach, Sass is usually not responsible for:

- recreating utility classes
- generating one-to-one replacements for framework utilities
- styling individual components that already compose cleanly with utilities

Duplicating utilities in Sass adds complexity without benefit.

---

## Where Sass Fits Well

Sass works well alongside utilities when it is used to:

- define design tokens
- generate CSS custom properties
- create small, focused abstractions utilities can consume
- organize non-utility styles (resets, base styles, layout primitives)

This keeps responsibilities clear and avoids overlap.

---

## A Practical Pattern

A common pattern is:

1. Define tokens in Sass
2. Generate CSS custom properties
3. Consume those variables from utilities

For example:

```scss
$colors: (
  primary: #3366ff,
  surface: #ffffff,
  text: #111111
);

:root {
  @each $name, $value in $colors {
    --#{$name}: #{$value};
  }
}
```

Utilities (or custom utilities) can then reference these variables rather than hard-coded values.

---

## Sass Is Not Competing with Utilities

Utility-first CSS is about *usage*.

Sass is about *authoring*.

When those roles are respected, the two tools complement each other instead of competing.

---

## When This Combination Makes Sense

Using Sass with utilities makes sense when:

- the project has shared tokens or themes
- generation or data structures reduce duplication
- runtime flexibility is still required

It makes less sense when Sass is used only to recreate utilities that already exist.

## ⏭ Knowing When to Stop

The last skill is judgment.

Next, we’ll look at when Sass genuinely helps a project — and when it’s better to leave it out entirely.

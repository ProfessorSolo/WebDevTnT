## Why File Structure Matters

As stylesheets grow, the challenge is no longer writing rules.

It’s **finding them**, **understanding them**, and **changing them safely**.

Good file structure doesn’t change what CSS can do.  
It changes how we reason about the codebase.

---

## One Entry Point

In a Sass-based workflow, we typically compile **one primary file**.

That file acts as the entry point for the entire stylesheet.

For example:

```text
styles/
└─ main.scss
```

The build platform compiles this file and produces the final CSS.

Everything else exists to support that entry point.

---

## Why a Single Entry File Works

Using a single entry file gives us:

- a predictable compilation target
- a clear place to start reading styles
- control over load order
- consistency with how JavaScript entry points work

Rather than scattering compiled outputs across multiple files, we compose styles deliberately from one place.

---

## Splitting Files for Clarity

As a project grows, a single file becomes harder to manage.

Sass allows us to split styles across multiple files and compose them back together.

For example:

```text
styles/
├─ main.scss
├─ _base.scss
├─ _layout.scss
└─ _components.scss
```

Only `main.scss` is intended to compile directly.

The other files exist to organize related concerns.

---

## Partials

Files that begin with an underscore are called **partials**.

Partials:

- are not compiled on their own
- exist to be included by other files
- help break large stylesheets into manageable pieces

This naming convention makes it clear which files are entry points and which are supporting pieces.

---

## Composing Files with `@use`

Modern Sass uses the `@use` rule to pull files together.

For example:

```scss
@use 'base';
@use 'layout';
@use 'components';
```

This makes file relationships explicit and avoids unintentional global side effects.

We’ll look more closely at `@use` and namespacing later in the chapter.

---

## File Structure Before Variables

At this stage, the goal is not reuse or abstraction.

It’s clarity.

Before introducing variables, mixins, or logic, we want a file structure that makes the stylesheet easy to navigate and reason about.

Once the structure is solid, adding shared values and patterns becomes much more straightforward.

---

## ⏭ Variables and Scope

With files organized and entry points established, we can introduce variables and talk about scope.

Next, we’ll look at how Sass variables work and how they differ from CSS custom properties.

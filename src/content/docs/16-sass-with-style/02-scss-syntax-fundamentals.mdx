## Why Syntax Matters

Before we talk about structure, reuse, or logic, we need to be clear about the language itself.

Sass is not a single syntax.

There are **two valid ways** to write Sass, and understanding that distinction helps explain many examples we’ll see online.

---

## Two Sass Syntaxes

Sass supports:

- **SCSS** — the syntax we’ll use in this course
- **Sass (indented syntax)** — the original form of the language

Both compile to CSS.  
Both are fully supported.  
Both are still valid today.

The difference is how closely they resemble CSS.

---

## SCSS: CSS, Extended

SCSS (Sassy CSS) was introduced to lower the barrier to adoption.

SCSS:

- uses curly braces and semicolons
- looks and feels like CSS
- allows plain CSS to be copied directly into a `.scss` file
- adds Sass features incrementally on top

For example:

```scss
.button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```

This is valid CSS _and_ valid SCSS.

Because of that compatibility, SCSS is the most widely used syntax today and the one we’ll focus on going forward.

---

## The Original Sass Syntax

The original Sass syntax uses indentation instead of braces and semicolons.

The same example written in Sass syntax looks like this:

```sass
.button
  background-color: blue
  color: white
```

This form is concise and expressive, but it requires learning a new structure that differs from CSS.

You may encounter this syntax in older projects or documentation. It is not deprecated, and it behaves the same way as SCSS once compiled.

For consistency, all examples in this course will use **SCSS**.

---

## Nesting Rules

One of the first features people associate with Sass is nesting.

Nesting allows us to write selectors inside other selectors:

```scss
.card {
  padding: 1rem;

  h2 {
    margin-top: 0;
  }
}
```

This can improve readability by keeping related rules together.

It can also make styles harder to reason about if nesting becomes too deep.

A good rule of thumb is to nest only when there is a clear structural relationship and to avoid nesting purely for convenience.

---

### A Note on Nesting and Modern CSS

Sass introduced nesting long before native CSS supported it.

For years, nesting was one of the most compelling reasons to use Sass, because it allowed related selectors to live together in a way that plain CSS could not express cleanly.

More recently, CSS has begun to adopt its own form of nesting. That evolution wasn’t accidental. The Sass approach proved useful enough in real-world authoring that it influenced how the platform itself evolved.

Even as native CSS nesting becomes more widely supported, Sass-style nesting remains relevant, especially in projects that already rely on preprocessing for structure and organization.

---

## The Parent Selector (`&`)

Sass introduces the parent selector, written as `&`.

It represents the full selector of the current context.

```scss
.button {
  background-color: blue;

  &:hover {
    background-color: darkblue;
  }
}
```

The `&` helps keep related states and variations close to the base selector without repeating it manually.

Sass compiles the above to the following CSS:

```css
.button {
  background-color: blue;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: darkblue;
}
```

---

## Comments in SCSS

SCSS supports two kinds of comments:

```scss
/* This comment appears in the compiled CSS */

// This comment exists only in the source file
```

Single-line comments are useful for documentation and notes that shouldn’t ship to production.

Block comments behave like standard CSS comments and are preserved in output.

---

## Readability Over Cleverness

Sass makes many patterns possible.

Not all of them are worth using.

Clear selectors, shallow nesting, and predictable output are more valuable than compact or clever syntax. As we move forward, we’ll prioritize readability and maintainability over terseness.

## ⏭ Structure Before Reuse

Now that we understand the surface of the language, we can look at how Sass helps organize styles across files.

Next, we’ll focus on structuring styles with Sass before introducing variables or reuse patterns.

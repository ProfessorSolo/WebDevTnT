## Why Variables Matter

Once files are structured, the next pressure point is repetition.

We start seeing the same values appear in multiple places:
- colors
- spacing values
- font sizes
- breakpoints

Variables give us a way to name those decisions and reuse them consistently.

---

## Sass Variables, Plainly

Sass variables are **compile-time values**.

They exist only while Sass is compiling our styles and are replaced with literal values in the generated CSS.

A basic example:

```scss
$primary-color: #3366ff;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
}
```

After compilation, the browser receives plain CSS with no awareness that variables were ever involved.

---

## Variable Scope

Unlike CSS custom properties, Sass variables follow **lexical scope**.

That means where a variable is defined determines where it can be used.

```scss
$base-padding: 1rem;

.card {
  padding: $base-padding;
}
```

Variables defined at the top level are available throughout the file (and to files that import them).

Variables defined inside a selector or block are limited to that scope.

---

## Local Scope Example

```scss
.card {
  $card-padding: 1.5rem;

  padding: $card-padding;
}
```

In this case, `$card-padding` is only available inside `.card`.

This can be useful for localized logic, but it’s generally better to keep shared values at higher, more visible levels.

---

## Defaults and Configuration

Sass allows variables to be defined with defaults using `!default`.

```scss
$gap: 1rem !default;
```

This pattern allows a value to be overridden before it’s used, while still providing a fallback.

Defaults become especially useful when variables are defined in one file and configured from another.

---

## Sass Variables vs CSS Custom Properties

Sass variables and CSS custom properties serve different purposes.

Sass variables:
- are resolved at compile time
- do not exist in the browser
- cannot change at runtime

CSS custom properties:
- exist at runtime
- participate in the cascade
- can be modified by media queries or JavaScript

In practice, Sass variables are well-suited for defining constants and generating styles, while CSS custom properties are better for theming and runtime flexibility.

We’ll explore how to combine the two later in the chapter.

---

## Naming and Intent

Variables are most effective when they express intent, not implementation details.

Names like `$primary-color` or `$base-spacing` communicate purpose more clearly than raw values or overly specific labels.

The goal is not to eliminate all repetition, but to make shared decisions explicit and easy to change.

## ⏭ Reuse, by Design

With variables in place, we can start looking at structured reuse.

Next, we’ll explore placeholders and `@extend`, and how they differ from mixins.

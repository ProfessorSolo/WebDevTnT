## Why Lists and Maps Matter

Loops are most effective when we can drive them with a small, deliberate source of truth.

Lists and maps give us structured data in Sass so that:

- we can generate consistent variants
- we can keep naming predictable
- we can avoid scattering related values throughout the stylesheet

---

## Lists, Plainly

A Sass list is an ordered set of values.

Lists can be space-separated or comma-separated.

```scss
$states: success warning danger;
```

or:

```scss
$states: (success, warning, danger);
```

We typically use lists when we only need the values themselves, not key/value pairing.

---

## Looping Over a List

```scss
$states: (success, warning, danger);

@each $state in $states {
  .badge--#{$state} {
    font-weight: 600;
  }
}
```

This creates a predictable set of selectors without hard-coding each one.

---

## Lists with Multiple Values Per Item

Lists can also contain sub-lists, which is useful when we want multiple values per item.

```scss
$spacings: (sm 0.5rem, md 1rem, lg 1.5rem);

@each $name, $value in $spacings {
  .gap-#{$name} {
    gap: $value;
  }
}
```

This pattern is compact, but as datasets grow, maps tend to be easier to read and maintain.

---

## Maps, Plainly

A Sass map is a set of key/value pairs.

```scss
$gaps: (
  sm: 0.5rem,
  md: 1rem,
  lg: 1.5rem,
);
```

Maps are a good fit when we want:

- a named key
- a corresponding value
- a dataset that may grow over time

---

## Looping Over a Map

```scss
$gaps: (
  sm: 0.5rem,
  md: 1rem,
  lg: 1.5rem,
);

@each $name, $value in $gaps {
  .gap-#{$name} {
    gap: $value;
  }
}
```

The intent is clear: each key becomes part of the class name, and each value becomes the property value.

---

## Looking Up Values in a Map

Maps become even more useful when we want to look up a value by key.

```scss
$breakpoints: (
  sm: 40rem,
  md: 52rem,
  lg: 64rem,
);

.container {
  max-width: map-get($breakpoints, md);
}
```

This keeps key decisions centralized and makes refactoring easier.

---

## Choosing Between Lists and Maps

A simple guideline:

- choose a **list** when the values alone are enough
- choose a **map** when we need stable names paired with values

Lists tend to be lighter weight.

Maps tend to be more maintainable as the dataset grows.

## ⏭ Runtime Flexibility

So far, Sass data structures have helped us generate consistent CSS at compile time.

Next, we’ll look at CSS custom properties and how they provide runtime flexibility that Sass variables cannot.

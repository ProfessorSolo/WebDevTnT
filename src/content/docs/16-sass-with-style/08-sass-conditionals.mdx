## Why Conditionals Matter

Sometimes we want Sass to make a decision while compiling.

Conditionals let us:

- select between values
- include or exclude declarations
- keep patterns consistent while allowing controlled variation

All of this happens at compile time. The browser receives only the resulting CSS.

---

## `@if` and `@else`, Plainly

Sass supports conditional logic using `@if`, `@else if`, and `@else`.

Here is a simple example that returns a value from a function:

```scss
@function radius($kind) {
  @if $kind == soft {
    @return 0.75rem;
  } @else if $kind == sharp {
    @return 0.25rem;
  } @else {
    @return 0.5rem;
  }
}

.card {
  border-radius: radius(soft);
}
```

Conditionals allow a single, named abstraction to map to a small set of deliberate options.

---

## Conditional Output in a Mixin

Conditionals are also useful inside mixins when we want optional declarations.

```scss
@mixin elevated($enabled: true) {
  @if $enabled {
    box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1.25rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
  }
}
```

Usage:

```scss
.card {
  @include elevated;
}

.flat-card {
  @include elevated(false);
}
```

This keeps the calling code readable while making the emission of CSS explicit.

---

## Keeping Conditionals Constrained

Conditionals are most effective when they control a small, well-defined set of outcomes.

Good practice includes:

- preferring a few named options over open-ended branching
- avoiding long chains of `@else if` unless the options are stable and intentional
- keeping conditionals close to the abstraction they control

The goal is predictable output and clear intent.

---

## What Conditionals Are Not

Conditionals do not run in the browser.

They do not respond to user interaction, media queries, or JavaScript after compilation.

If we need runtime variation, we use CSS custom properties, media queries, or separate selectors.

## ⏭ Controlled Generation

Once we can branch, we can also generate repeated patterns intentionally.

Next, we’ll look at Sass loops and how they can help (or harm) readability depending on how they’re used.

## The Point of This Exercise

This chapter covered a lot of capability.

This page is about **judgment**.

The goal is not to use every Sass feature.  
The goal is to decide which ones actually help in a given situation.

---

## Starting Point

Imagine a small but growing UI with:

- cards
- buttons
- panels
- spacing utilities
- a light and dark theme

Assume we already have a modern build setup in place.

Our task is to decide **where Sass helps** and **where plain CSS or utilities are enough**.

---

## Step 1: Identify Repetition

Scan the styles (real or imagined) and ask:

- Are values repeating?
- Are patterns repeating?
- Are roles repeating?

Make a short list of:
- repeated values (colors, spacing, sizes)
- repeated structures (layout, surfaces, text treatments)
- repeated behaviors (states, variants)

Do not write code yet. Just identify pressure points.

---

## Step 2: Choose the Right Tool

For each item you identified, decide:

- Variable?
- Placeholder?
- Mixin?
- Function?
- Loop?
- Or none of the above?

Be explicit about *why*.

If plain CSS is clearer, that is a valid and often correct answer.

---

## Step 3: Avoid Overreach

Ask a second set of questions:

- Does this abstraction reduce repetition *and* improve clarity?
- Will someone else understand this without explanation?
- Does the generated output remain predictable?

If the answer is unclear, scale the abstraction back.

---

## Step 4: Combine with CSS Variables

Where runtime flexibility matters:

- themes
- user preferences
- responsive overrides

Decide whether Sass should:
- generate CSS custom properties, or
- stay out of the decision entirely

Avoid solving runtime problems at compile time.

---

## Reflection

Answer these honestly:

- Where did Sass feel helpful?
- Where did it feel unnecessary?
- Which features were easiest to misuse?
- Which ones improved readability the most?

The goal is not feature coverage.

It’s **disciplined use**.

## ⏭ Compact Reference

Now that we’ve applied Sass intentionally, the final page collects the core syntax, patterns, and reminders in one place.

Next, we’ll close with a compact Sass compendium.

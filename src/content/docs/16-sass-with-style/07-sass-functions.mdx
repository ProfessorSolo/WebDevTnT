## Why Functions Matter

Mixins help us reuse declarations.

Sometimes, we don’t want to emit a block of CSS at all.  
We want to compute a value and use it in a property.

That is the job of a function.

---

## Functions, Plainly

A Sass function takes inputs and returns a single value.

We define a function with `@function` and return a value with `@return`.

```scss
@function space($multiplier) {
  @return $multiplier * 0.5rem;
}
```

Usage:

```scss
.card {
  padding: space(2);
  margin-bottom: space(3);
}
```

---

## Why Use a Function Instead of a Variable?

Variables store values. Functions compute values.

Functions are useful when:

- we want consistent math across the stylesheet
- we need a reusable formula
- the output should change based on input

A spacing function is a common example because it centralizes the scale and enforces consistency.

---

## A Practical Example: Spacing Scale

```scss
@function space($step) {
  @return $step * 0.5rem;
}

.stack {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: space(2);
}
```

This keeps spacing decisions consistent and avoids scattering “magic numbers” throughout the codebase.

---

## Returning Computed Colors

Functions are also useful for deriving colors.

```scss
@function tint($color, $amount) {
  @return mix(white, $color, $amount);
}

.badge {
  background-color: tint(#3366ff, 20%);
}
```

The goal is not to generate endless variants, but to keep relationships between colors deliberate.

---

## Functions vs Mixins

Both features can contain logic, but they serve different roles.

- Functions return values
- Mixins emit declarations

If we want a value for a single property, a function is usually the better fit.

If we want a reusable block of rules, a mixin is usually the better fit.

---

## Keeping Functions Predictable

Functions are most helpful when:

- inputs and outputs are obvious
- naming reflects intent
- results are stable and easy to reason about

Functions can become confusing when they hide too much styling logic or generate unexpected results.

We want functions that improve consistency, not functions that obscure decisions.

## ⏭ Conditional Logic

Functions become even more useful once we can branch based on input.

Next, we’ll look at `@if` and `@else`, and how conditional logic affects what Sass emits at compile time.

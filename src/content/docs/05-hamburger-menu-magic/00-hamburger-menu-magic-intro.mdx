# **Responsive Navigation**

Welcome to **Hamburger Menu Magic**, the module where we take a sad, rigid menu and turn it into responsive royalty.

By the end, we'll wonder how they ever tolerated that crusty “desktop-only” navigation.

Below is our quick, stylish, zero-fluff pre-show before the five chapters.

## 🍿 What’s About to Happen

We’ll move through the five glow-up stages of modern nav:

1. **01 · The Menu That Wouldn’t**  
   The stubborn, non-responsive menu that refuses to shrink, bend, or behave.  
   A perfect disasterpiece to fix.

2. **02 · Flex to Impress**  
   Ah yes — the “I finally read one article about Flexbox” era.  
   Things _start_ making sense.

3. **03 · Bun and Done**  
   The classic hamburger drop-down.  
   Small viewport? No problem. Big personality.

4. **04 · Sneaky Slideout**  
   The left-side drawer that whispers, “I contain _multitudes_.”

5. **05 · Overlay Dramatic**  
   The menu equivalent of throwing rose petals while descending a staircase.  
   Full-screen, cinematic, spotlight-on-you navigation.

## 🧠 Core Ideas (Before We Unleash the Chaos)

### Mobile First

If your menu only looks good on a 1920×1080 monitor… it’s not a menu, it’s a liability.

### Predictable Structure

One HTML shell. Five transformations. Endless teaching clarity.

### Responsive Models

We’re exploring three major spatial metaphors:

- **Below-the-header dropdown**
- **Off-canvas drawer**
- **Full-viewport overlay**

### Accessibility is Non‑Negotiable

`aria-expanded`, keyboard control, and focus flow come baked in like good seasoning.

## 🔍 Lesson Flow Ahead

**01 — The Menu That Wouldn’t**  
Show students the “before” state. It’s deliciously awful.

**02 — Flex to Impress**  
Introduce flexible layouts that don’t crack under pressure.

**03 — Bun and Done**  
Hamburger drop-down with basic toggle logic.

**04 — Sneaky Slideout**  
Left drawer charm offensive.

**05 — Overlay Dramatic**  
The final form. Full-screen. Bold. Unapologetic.

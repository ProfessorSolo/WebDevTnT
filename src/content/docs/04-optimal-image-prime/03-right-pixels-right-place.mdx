# srcset and sizes

Once your images are safely contained, it’s time to train the browser to choose
the **right pixels** for each situation — not too big, not too small, and never wasting bandwidth.

This lesson introduces **`srcset`** and **`sizes`**: the dynamic duo that lets the browser
pick the most efficient image for any viewport width.

---

## 🎯 The goal

You want:

- small images on small screens
- big images on wide screens
- crisp images on retina displays
- **zero** wasted downloads

And you want the browser to handle this automatically.

That’s where `srcset` and `sizes` step in.

## 🧩 The Problem: One Image Doesn’t Fit All

If you load a single 2048px hero image everywhere, then:

- mobile users download way more than they need
- desktop users might see a blurry image
- everyone wastes data

And the browser has no idea what size the image will _actually_ render at.

---

## 🛠 The Fix: `srcset` + `sizes`

Here’s the pattern:

```html
<img
  src="./images/unicorn-small.jpg"
  srcset="
    ./images/unicorn-small.jpg   600w,
    ./images/unicorn-medium.jpg 1200w,
    ./images/unicorn-large.jpg  2000w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw,
         (max-width: 1200px) 70vw,
         50vw"
  alt="A cyberpunk steampunk unicorn in a fantasy landscape"
/>
```

### How it works

- **`srcset`** lists the available image widths
- **`sizes`** tells the browser how big the image will be _on the page_
- The browser picks the **smallest file** that still looks sharp at that rendered size

Boom: perfect pixel delivery.

## 👀 See it in action

<img
  src="/assets/lessons/m4-right-pixels-right-place-small.jpg"
  srcset="
    /assets/lessons/m4-right-pixels-right-place-small.jpg 600w,
    /assets/lessons/m4-right-pixels-right-place-medium.jpg 1200w,
    /assets/lessons/m4-right-pixels-right-place-large.jpg 2000w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw,
         (max-width: 1200px) 70vw,
         50vw"
  alt="A cyberpunk steampunk unicorn in a fantasy landscape"
  style={{ borderRadius: '1rem', marginBlock: '1rem' }}
/>

> 💡 Open DevTools → Network → Img → throttle to “Fast 3G,” resize your window,
> and watch the browser download different images for different breakpoints.

## 📐 Understanding `sizes`

This line:

```html
sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 70vw, 50vw"
```

translates to:

- If the viewport is **600px or smaller** → image will render **full width**
- If the viewport is **1200px or smaller** → image will render at **70% of the viewport**
- Otherwise → **50%**

The browser uses these rules _before downloading anything_, ensuring it picks exactly the image it needs.

## 🧠 When to use `srcset` + `sizes`

Use this pattern when:

- The same photo should scale across breakpoints
- You want fewer bytes on mobile and crispness on desktop
- The image appears **inline**, not as a background
- You don’t need totally different artwork (that’s what `<picture>` is for)

Now that your images load the right pixels at the right time, it’s time for a little art direction magic:

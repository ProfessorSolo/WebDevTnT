# Keep Images in their Containers with max-width

Responsive images aren’t just about loading the _right_ pixels — they’re also about
making sure those pixels don’t punch a hole through your layout.

This lesson focuses on **image containment**: the pattern that keeps big, beautiful
images from overflowing their container on narrow viewports.

## 🤯 The problem: uncontained images

By default, an `<img>` element renders at its **intrinsic size**.  
If you drop a 1792px-wide hero image into a layout that’s only 360px wide, the
image will happily overflow and force horizontal scrolling.

That’s what the first version of our demo shows:

- a huge steampunk ship hero image
- no max-width rule
- the image overflows its container on small screens

---

## 🛡 The fix: `max-width: 100%` + `height: auto`

The classic containment pattern is tiny but powerful:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  display: block;
}
```

What this does:

- **`max-width: 100%`** → never let the image grow wider than its container
- **`height: auto`** → keep the aspect ratio correct while scaling down
- **`display: block`** → removes inline whitespace and plays nicer in most layouts

Drop this into your shared stylesheet and every image will:

- shrink gracefully on small screens
- respect its container
- stay sharp on larger breakpoints (as long as the source image is large enough)

## 👀 See containment in action

In the demo, we use a single large hero image of a steampunk airship in a storm.

Once you’ve wired up your assets, you can drop examples like this into your content:

| State           | Notes                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Uncontained** | The image renders at its full intrinsic width and blows past the card.   |
| **Contained**   | `max-width: 100%` keeps the image neatly inside the main content column. |

> 💡 In DevTools, toggle the `img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }` rule on and off
> to show students the difference in real time.

You can generate these screenshots directly from your `contain-yourself` demo page
and save them as:

## 🧩 How this fits into the bigger picture

This pattern doesn’t handle **which** image is loaded — that’s the job of:

- `<img srcset>` and `sizes` (resolution switching)
- `<picture>` (art direction)
- `image-set()` in CSS (backgrounds)

Instead, `Contain Yourself` is all about **layout sanity**:

> First, make sure images can’t wreck your page.  
> Then, optimize which pixels you send.

Once you’ve locked in image containment, you’re ready for
**Right Pixels, Right Place** and **Picture Rolling Action!**.

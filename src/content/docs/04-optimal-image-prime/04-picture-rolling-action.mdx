# Art Direction with `<picture>`

Sometimes you don’t just want a bigger or smaller version of the **same** image —  
you want a totally different _shot_ at different breakpoints.

That’s **art direction**, and the `<picture>` element is your director’s chair.

In this lesson, we’ll swap between:

- a **wide establishing shot** of the cat film set on larger screens
- a **square behind-the-scenes shot** on smaller screens

Same scene, different storytelling.

---

## 🎬 The idea

`<picture>` lets you:

- use different files at different viewport widths
- still use `srcset` for 1x/2x (or more) inside each source
- fall back cleanly to a regular `<img>` if nothing else matches

This is perfect when the mobile view deserves its own composition instead of just a crop.

---

## 🔧 The Code

```html
<picture>
  <!-- Wide screens: landscape shot -->
  <source srcset=".images/example-wide.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)" />

  <!-- Small screens: square shot -->
  <source srcset=".images/example-square.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)" />

  <!-- Fallback -->
  <img
    src=".images/example-square.jpg"
    alt="Art-directed image that changes shape by screen size"
  />
</picture>
```

## 💡 What This Does

- **Large screens** load the **wide / landscape** image
- **Small screens** load the **square / mobile-friendly** image
- The `<img>` fallback ensures broad compatibility
- Browser checks **media queries first**, then picks the first supported `<source>`
- This is true **art direction**: the composition, not just the size, changes

## 🎥 Live demo — wide to square

Resize your browser to see the art direction swap:

- **Wide viewport (≥ 768px)** → wide establishing shot
- **Narrow viewport (< 768px)** → square behind-the-scenes shot

<picture className="pra-demo-image">
  {/* Large screens: wide establishing shot */}
  <source
    srcSet="
      /assets/lessons/m4-CatCityWide-1x.webp 1x,
      /assets/lessons/m4-CatCityWide-2x.webp 2x
    "
    type="image/webp"
    media="(min-width: 768px)"
  />
  <source
    srcSet="
      /assets/lessons/m4-CatCityWide-1x.jpg 1x,
      /assets/lessons/m4-CatCityWide-2x.jpg 2x
    "
    type="image/jpeg"
    media="(min-width: 768px)"
  />

{/* Small screens: square behind-the-scenes shot */}

{' '}

<source
  srcSet="
      /assets/lessons/m4-CatSquareBehindTheScenes-1x.webp 1x,
      /assets/lessons/m4-CatSquareBehindTheScenes-2x.webp 2x
    "
  type="image/webp"
  media="(max-width: 767px)"
/>
<source
  srcSet="
      /assets/lessons/m4-CatSquareBehindTheScenes-1x.jpg 1x,
      /assets/lessons/m4-CatSquareBehindTheScenes-2x.jpg 2x
    "
  type="image/jpeg"
  media="(max-width: 767px)"
/>

{/* Fallback if nothing else matches */}

  <img
    src="/assets/lessons/m4-CatSquareBehindTheScenes-1x.jpg"
    alt="Cat film crew on set in a neon-lit studio"
    loading="lazy"
    style={{ borderRadius: '1rem', maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</picture>

> 💡 Tip: you can also drop this `<picture>` directly into your Starlight layout
> and style `.pra-demo-image` with your shared CSS.

## 🧠 How `<picture>` makes the call

The browser processes `<picture>` like this:

1. Check each `<source>` **top to bottom**
2. Ignore sources whose `media` doesn’t match
3. Among the matching ones, pick the first with a supported `type`
4. Use that `srcset` to choose the right density (1x / 2x / etc.)
5. If nothing matches, fall back to the `<img>` at the bottom

So in our case:

- On a small viewport, only the square `media="(max-width: 767px)"` sources apply
- On a wide viewport, only the wide `media="(min-width: 768px)"` sources apply

Within those, the browser still respects `1x` vs `2x`.

---

## 🔍 Things to point out in DevTools

- Resize the viewport and watch **which file** is requested in **Network → Img**
- On a retina simulator, see the `2x` versions load instead of `1x`
- Use the **Elements panel** to show how `<picture>` wraps the `<img>`

This drives home that `<picture>` is:

> art direction at the layout level,  
> plus resolution negotiation inside each branch.

---

## 🎯 When to reach for `<picture>`

Use `<picture>` when:

- mobile and desktop deserve different compositions
- you want to swap between square, portrait, and wide shots
- text or UI overlays are baked into the image
- the meaning of the shot changes with layout

If the image is purely decorative and lives in CSS, use
[`image-set()` instead](./on-set-image-set).

Your cat film crew just gave your students a front-row seat to art-directed responsive images.

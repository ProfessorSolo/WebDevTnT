# **CSS Tranform(er)s**

Welcome to Lesson 06 — where static boxes finally loosen up and _change_ shape.

This module stays tightly focused on **what we can do with transforms alone**:

- **2D Transforms:** rotate, scale, translate, skew
- **3D Transforms:** rotateX/Y/Z, perspective
- **Origins:** pivot points that change the entire vibe
- **Assemblies:** combining multiple transforms cleanly (and knowing why order matters)
- **A tiny, tiny taste of transitions** — just enough to prep you for the next module:  
  **07 · Ion Drive: Transition Lab**

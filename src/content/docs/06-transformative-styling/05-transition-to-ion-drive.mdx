# **From A to B — Smooooothly**

We’ve learned how to **pose** elements in impossible ways.

Now it’s time to _hint_ at motion — the smallest taste of what’s coming in lesson **007 · Ion Drive: Transition Lab**.

We keep it light here.  
Just enough to feel the magic starting to spark, without stealing thunder from the full transition deep dive.

## Tiny Taste of Motion

Hover the goat — your first micro‑transition.

<div class="ps-stage">
  <img
    class="ps-goat"
    src="/assets/lessons/m5-space-goat-256w.webp"
    alt="Space goat gently lifting and tilting on hover."
  />
</div>

```css
.goat {
  transition: transform 350ms ease;
}
.goat:hover {
  transform: translateY(-20px) rotate(8deg) scale(1.05);
}
```

This is the entire idea behind transitions:

- a **start state**
- an **end state**
- and a **timeline** that connects the two

Everything else is seasoning.

## What’s _not_ here yet

We’re not touching:

- timing functions beyond `ease`
- complex keyframes
- delays
- staggering
- transition composition

Those live in **Ion Drive** — where the real fun begins.

➡️ Next up: **07 · Ion Drive: Transition Lab** — motion becomes deliberate, expressive, and neon-powered.

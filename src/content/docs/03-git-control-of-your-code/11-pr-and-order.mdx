# PR and Order

Welcome to **PR and Order** — the courtroom drama of version control, where branches argue their case before being merged into `main`.

This is where collaboration gets real — code is reviewed, feedback is shared, and quality rises.

---

## ⚖️ What a Pull Request Really Is

A **Pull Request** (PR) is a formal way to say:

> “I’ve made changes on this branch. I think they’re ready. Let’s review before merging.”

It’s not just about merging code — it’s about **communication**.

ASCII courtroom sketch:

```
main ──●──●────────▶
          \
           └──●──●──▶ feature/add-form
```

The PR compares one branch (often `feature/add-form`) against another (often `main`) and asks for judgment.

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Create a Pull Request

1. Commit and push your branch to GitHub
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/add-form
   ```
2. Go to your repository on GitHub
3. Click **Compare & pull request**
4. Write a clear title and description (what you did and why)
5. Submit for review

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Titles are headlines. Descriptions are context.  
If your PR needs a scroll bar, it’s too big — break it up.

---

## 💬 Step 2: The Review Process

Reviews are about improvement, not perfection.  
When someone reviews your PR, they might:

- Ask questions (“Why this approach?”)
- Spot bugs or inconsistencies
- Suggest better naming or structure
- Compliment clever code (don’t skip that part!)

Example feedback:

> 💬 “Nice accessibility fix! Could we use a semantic `<button>` here instead of a `<div>`?”

Respectful feedback turns reviews into **conversations**, not conflicts.

---

## 🧠 Step 3: Respond and Revise

We can update our PR anytime by pushing more commits to the same branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Refactor header for accessibility"
git push
```

GitHub updates the PR automatically.

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Don’t take code reviews personally. Take them professionally.  
Every review is a free lesson in better coding.

## 🪄 Step 4: Merging the PR

Once everyone’s happy, it’s time to merge.  
GitHub offers three options:

| Method               | When to Use               | What It Does                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Merge Commit**     | Default option            | Keeps full history                               |
| **Squash and Merge** | For small/focused PRs     | Combines commits into one clean snapshot         |
| **Rebase and Merge** | For linear history lovers | Rewrites commit order into one straight timeline |

⚠️ **Caution:** Rebasing rewrites history — great for your branch, risky for shared ones.

---

## 🧩 Step 5: Clean Up the Branch

After merging, keep your repo tidy:

```bash
git branch -d feature/add-form
git push origin --delete feature/add-form
```

A clean repo is a happy repo.  
Old branches are like leftovers — deal with them before they smell.

## 🎓 Step 6: Review Etiquette — The Laws of PR and Order

| Rule           | Why It Matters                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Be clear       | Ambiguity wastes time                                      |
| Be kind        | Reviews are for learning, not ego                          |
| Be concise     | Nobody likes a wall of text                                |
| Be accountable | Explain your changes and decisions                         |
| Be curious     | Ask questions, not just for approval but for understanding |

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Good reviewers ask, “Can I understand this?” not “Can I improve this?”  
Clarity beats cleverness every time.

## ✅ Mission Check: Order Restored

By now, we can:

1. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
2. Write clear titles and context
3. Participate in a respectful review process
4. Merge PRs with confidence and clarity
5. Keep repos clean and organized post-merge

💡 **Professor Solo says:**

> “In this court of code, clarity is justice.  
> PRs aren’t paperwork — they’re how we keep chaos civilized.”

# Tag, You're It!

Some moments deserve to be remembered forever — your first working prototype, a bug‑free release, or that one time you actually finished before the deadline.  
That’s what **tags** are for. They mark milestones in your project’s history.

---

## 🧠 What a Tag Really Is

A **tag** is a label attached to a specific commit — a snapshot in time we want to bookmark.

ASCII time‑stamp magic:

```
●──●──●──●──●──▶
         ↑
        v1.0.0  ← tagged commit
```

Tags don’t change or move. They’re fixed markers in history, perfect for releases and submissions.

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Commits tell a story, but tags define the chapters.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Create a Tag

There are two kinds of tags — **lightweight** and **annotated**.

### Lightweight (quick and casual)

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

Just a label — simple and fast.

### Annotated (professional grade)

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First stable release"
```

Includes the author, date, and a message — ideal for official milestones.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: View and Manage Tags

List all tags in your repo:

```bash
git tag
```

See details for a specific tag:

```bash
git show v1.0.0
```

Delete a tag (if needed):

```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0
```

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Tags are like trophies — only delete them if you really didn’t earn them.

---

## 🧮 Step 3: Push Tags to GitHub

By default, `git push` doesn’t send tags.  
We need to share them explicitly:

```bash
git push origin --tags
```

Or push one tag at a time:

```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Now the tag appears on GitHub under the **Releases** section — easy for others to download or reference.

---

## 🧭 Step 4: Semantic Versioning (aka SemVer)

Semantic Versioning is the industry’s way of numbering releases meaningfully.

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

| Version   | Meaning                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **1.0.0** | First public or stable release           |
| **1.1.0** | Added new features (backward compatible) |
| **1.1.1** | Bug fixes or small improvements          |
| **2.0.0** | Breaking changes or major redesign       |

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Start at `v0.1.0` for early projects. Move to `v1.0.0` when it’s showtime.

---

## 🧠 Step 5: Using Tags in the Real World

| Context             | Example          |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Student submission  | `v1.0.0-final`   |
| Midterm checkpoint  | `v0.5.0-midterm` |
| Production release  | `v2.3.1`         |
| Experimental branch | `v0.9.0-beta`    |

We can even tag specific commits retroactively:

```bash
git tag -a v1.1.0 a1b2c3d -m "Add responsive layout"
```

---

## ⚙️ Step 6: Releases on GitHub

GitHub turns tags into downloadable releases.

1. Go to your repo’s **Releases** tab
2. Click **Draft a new release**
3. Choose your tag (or create one)
4. Add release notes and publish

Perfect for sharing packaged builds, assignment submissions, or project milestones.

---

## ✅ Mission Check: You’ve Been Tagged

By now, we can:

1. Create lightweight and annotated tags
2. View, delete, and push tags to GitHub
3. Follow semantic versioning conventions
4. Use tags to mark milestones and releases
5. Publish official releases on GitHub

💡 **Professor Solo says:**

> “Every project has a story.  
> Tags are how we name the chapters — and remember the hits.”

# 1️⃣ Suit Up: Installing & Configuring Git

Before we can travel through time, we need our **gear** — and in our world, that gear is **Git**.

Git is the engine that powers version control.  
It’s not fancy, but it’s unstoppable — a command-line superhero that quietly tracks every twist and turn of your code’s story.

---

## 🧰 Step 1: Installing Git

Git runs just about everywhere — and installation is usually painless.

| System      | Command or Link                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Windows** | [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org) — includes **Git Bash**, a lightweight terminal for running Git commands |
| **macOS**   | `brew install git` or download from [git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)                        |
| **Linux**   | `sudo apt install git` (Debian/Ubuntu) or your distro’s package manager                                                 |

After installing, open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and test it:

```bash
git --version
```

If you get a version number, you’re good to go.  
If you get an error, check your PATH — Git needs to be accessible globally.

### 🧠 Note: What “Installing Git” Really Means

Installing Git doesn’t just give us one program — it adds a **command-line tool** and a **background system** that remembers changes to files and folders.

When we type commands like `git init` or `git status`, we’re really just telling that system:

> “Hey Git, track what’s happening in this folder.”

That invisible magic happens through a hidden directory called `.git`.  
(You won’t see it unless you ask Git to show it — but it’s always watching. 👀)

---

## 🪟 Optional: GitHub Desktop

If the command line feels intimidating at first, GitHub Desktop is your friendly training wheels.

- [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Works on both **Mac** and **Windows**
- Includes Git automatically

💡 **Professor Solo’s Take:**  
GitHub Desktop is great for visualizing your work and getting started quickly.  
But… we’ll still learn to use the **CLI (Command Line Interface)** because it’s faster, more precise, and doesn’t change every time the UI does.

If you can drive Git from the command line, you can use _any_ Git tool in the world.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Configure Git (Identity & Defaults)

The first time we install Git, it knows nothing about us.  
Before we start committing, we need to introduce ourselves — politely, like good developers.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

🧠 **What’s Happening Here:**

- `user.name` and `user.email` become your signature.
- Every commit includes this info, so GitHub and teammates know who did what.

---

### 🪩 Customize Your Experience

We can also tweak how Git behaves:

```bash
git config --global color.ui auto
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

- `color.ui auto` gives you pretty color-coded output
- `init.defaultBranch main` makes “main” the default branch instead of “master” (modern convention)

---

### 💡 Professor Solo’s Pro Tip

Let’s make Git friendlier with some aliases — little shortcuts for the commands we’ll use most:

```bash
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.lg "log --oneline --graph --decorate --all"
```

Now we can type things like:

```bash
git st     # instead of git status
git lg     # visual log of history
```

That’s not cheating — that’s efficient rebellion.

---

## 🧩 Step 3: Verify Your Configuration

```bash
git config --list
```

This command lists all your active settings — everything Git knows about you and how it’s configured.  
If something looks off, edit or remove entries with:

```bash
git config --global --edit
```

It’ll open your config file in your default text editor.

---

## ⚠️ Caution: Global vs Local Configs

When we use `--global`, we’re changing Git’s settings for **every project** on the computer.

If we just want different settings for one project (say, a school account vs personal account):

```bash
git config --local user.email "school@example.edu"
```

Git reads settings in this order:

1. Local (project-specific)
2. Global (user-wide)
3. System (machine-wide)

So local overrides global.

---

## ✅ Mission Check: Our First Commit-Ready Setup

When this page’s steps are complete, we should be able to:

1. Open a terminal
2. Type `git --version` and get a response
3. Type `git config --list` and see our name, email, and color settings
4. Feel a tiny spark of power knowing we’ve just joined the league of version-controlled developers

> Time to suit up.”

# Why Git Happens

Version control isn’t just about saving code — it’s about **saving our sanity**.  
Without it, projects descend into chaos faster than a caffeine-fueled all-nighter.

We’ve all done it:

```
final-project.zip
final-FINAL-project.zip
final-FINAL-V2-fixed.zip
```

Git exists so we can stop doing that.  
It’s a **system for keeping track of change**, not just code — a time machine for our creativity.

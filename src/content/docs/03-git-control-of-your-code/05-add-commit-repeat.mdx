# 3️⃣ Add, Commit, Repeat

Welcome to the heartbeat of Git.  
Everything we do — every feature, every fix, every experiment — flows through this rhythm:

```
Edit → Add → Commit → Repeat
```

We’ve already made our first commit. Now it’s time to understand the loop that keeps every project alive.

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Edit Something Worth Tracking

Let’s imagine we’re working on a simple project called `my-portfolio`.  
Inside, we have an `index.html` file.

We add a new section:

```html
<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Web Developer. Lifelong Learner. Coffee Enthusiast.</p>
</section>
```

We’ve changed a file — Git notices immediately.  
But until we **add** it, Git’s just watching quietly, waiting for instructions.

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Stage the Change

Staging is how we tell Git, “Yes, this is part of the next snapshot.”

```bash
git add index.html
```

Want to see what’s staged? Run:

```bash
git status
```

You’ll see something like:

```
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified: index.html
```

🧠 **Translation:**  
We’ve placed this file in the **staging area** — Git’s waiting room for our next commit.

---

## 🧱 Step 3: Commit (Save the Moment)

Now we lock in the change with a **commit** — a permanent entry in our project’s history.

```bash
git commit -m "Add About Me section to homepage"
```

💡 The `-m` flag lets us add a **commit message** — short, descriptive, and human-readable.

### ✍️ About Commit Messages

Commit messages are our time machine notes.  
They tell future-us *why* we did something, not just *what* we did.

Good commit messages are:
- Written in **present tense** (“Add feature,” not “Added feature”)
- Short — ideally under 72 characters
- Focused — one commit = one idea

**Examples:**
```
feat: add contact form and email validation
fix: correct typo in navigation menu
docs: update README with setup steps
```

⚠️ **Bad examples:**
```
update
stuff
fixed it
final final version (for real this time)
```

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
A commit message is a story title, not the entire chapter.

---

## 🧮 Step 4: Stage & Commit Multiple Files

If you’ve changed several files:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new portfolio projects section"
```

That `.` means “everything in this folder that changed.”  
Use it with caution — Git will happily commit files you didn’t mean to include.

---

## 🧹 Step 5: Keep It Clean with .gitignore

Some files don’t belong in version control — logs, caches, temporary builds, or personal configs.

Create a file named `.gitignore` in your repo root and list what to exclude:

```
# macOS junk
.DS_Store

# Node dependencies
node_modules/

# Build outputs
dist/

# Environment variables
.env
```

Once a file is ignored, Git won’t track it anymore.  
This keeps your repo light and professional.

---

## ⚙️ Step 6: Review History

Let’s take a peek at what we’ve done so far:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
```

It might look something like:

```
* e7ab23f (HEAD -> main) Add About Me section to homepage
* 1e9b312 Initial commit — project setup
```

💡 Each dot (●) is a snapshot of our project at that moment in time.  
Git never forgets — and that’s a good thing.

---

## ✅ Mission Check: The Heartbeat of Git

By now, we can:
1. Edit a file, stage it, and commit it with confidence  
2. Write clear, meaningful commit messages  
3. Use `.gitignore` to keep our repo focused  
4. Understand the flow of **Edit → Add → Commit → Repeat**

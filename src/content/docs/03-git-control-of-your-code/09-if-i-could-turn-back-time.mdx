# If I Could Turn Back Time

Even the best of us make mistakes — wrong edits, premature commits, or the dreaded “oops, I deleted the wrong file.”  
Good news: Git lets us **turn back time** without drama.

We can’t undo a bad hair day, but we _can_ undo a bad commit.

---

## 🧭 Step 1: Unstage Without Losing Work

If we accidentally added the wrong file to staging, we can pull it back out:

```bash
git restore --staged index.html
```

This keeps the file’s changes, but removes it from the staging area.

ASCII time machine view:

```
Working Directory   ← still has your edits
Staging Area        ← file removed from here
Repository          ← unchanged
```

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Think of this as “unchecking a box” — you’re not deleting, just deselecting.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Discard Changes in the Working Directory

If we’ve changed something and want to go back to how it looked in the last commit:

```bash
git restore index.html
```

⚠️ **Caution:** This wipes your current edits — gone for good unless you stashed or committed first.

Use it only when you’re sure you don’t need those changes.

---

## 🧩 Step 3: Undo the Last Commit (Without Losing Work)

Sometimes we commit too soon — maybe forgot a file, or need a better message.

```bash
git commit --amend
```

This reopens the last commit, letting us add new changes or rewrite the message.

💡 Git doesn’t replace your commit — it creates a new one behind the scenes.

---

## 🧮 Step 4: Rewind to an Earlier Commit

When we need to step backward through history:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

This moves the HEAD pointer back one commit — erasing the most recent commit _and_ the changes.

ASCII flashback moment:

```
HEAD → ●──●──▶
         ↑
     rolled back here
```

⚠️ **Warning:** `--hard` deletes uncommitted work.  
Use with care — and maybe a deep breath.

---

## 🧠 Step 5: Safer Alternative — Soft Reset

Want to keep your changes but uncommit them?

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

This moves HEAD back one commit, but leaves all your work staged and ready to recommit.

💡 Perfect for “oops, wrong message” moments.

---

## 🧹 Step 6: Stash Your Work for Later

Need to switch branches but don’t want to commit unfinished work?

```bash
git stash -m "Work in progress on homepage"
```

Your changes vanish from view — but safely tucked away.

List all stashes:

```bash
git stash list
```

Bring one back:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

Git magic: your edits reappear exactly where you left them.

---

## 🕵️ Step 7: Find What Was Lost (reflog)

Even when we think we’ve lost everything, Git keeps a secret diary — the **reflog**.

```bash
git reflog
```

It lists every movement of HEAD — commits, resets, checkouts, even detached time travel.

Example output:

```
a1b2c3d (HEAD -> main) HEAD@{0}: commit: Update footer text
d4e5f6a HEAD@{1}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
f7a8b9c HEAD@{2}: commit: Add footer section
```

If disaster strikes, we can always rescue an old commit with:

```bash
git switch -c rescue a1b2c3d
```

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
The reflog is your safety net — it remembers even the moments you regret.

---

## ✅ Mission Check: Time Travel Achieved

By now, we can:

1. Unstage files without deleting them (`git restore --staged`)
2. Discard local changes safely (`git restore`)
3. Amend or undo recent commits (`git commit --amend`, `git reset`)
4. Stash work for later (`git stash`)
5. Recover from chaos with `git reflog`

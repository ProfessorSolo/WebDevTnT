# 🧠 Professor Solo Presents: _Git Control of Your Code_

> _“For every student who ever thought ‘final’ meant finished.”_

## A Note from Professor Solo

Welcome, web wizards and code conjurers!

If we’ve made it this far, we’ve already learned that in web development, **final doesn’t exist** — it’s just a fancy word for “current.”
Every project evolves, every experiment leads to another discovery, and every “oops” becomes part of the learning lore.

That’s what **Git** is really about — not just tracking code, but tracking **curiosity**.

It’s the story of _how_ we build, _why_ we change things, and _what_ we learn along the way.

We can think of Git as our project’s **time machine**:

```
🕰️ Past  — where we started
⚙️ Present — where we’re experimenting
🚀 Future — where we want to take it next
```

Every commit is a snapshot of our thinking at that moment.

Every branch is a new “what if?” we can explore safely.

And every merge is the story of how our ideas come together.

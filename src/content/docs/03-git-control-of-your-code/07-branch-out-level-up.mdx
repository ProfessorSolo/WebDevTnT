# Branch Out, Level Up

We’ve been living a single, linear timeline — one commit after another.  
But what if we want to try something new _without breaking what’s working_?

Welcome to **branching**, Git’s superpower for exploring alternate realities.

---

## 🌿 What a Branch Really Is

A branch isn’t a copy of your project — it’s just a pointer to a commit.  
Think of it as a **timeline bookmark** that can grow in a new direction.

```
main ──●──●──●──●──▶
          \
           └──●──●──▶ feature/add-bio
```

💡 Each branch can move independently. When we switch branches, we’re essentially _time traveling_ between versions of our code.

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Create and Switch Branches

We create a new branch like this:

```bash
git branch feature/add-bio
```

That makes the branch, but doesn’t move us to it yet.  
To hop timelines:

```bash
git switch feature/add-bio
```

Or do both in one step:

```bash
git switch -c feature/add-bio
```

Now we’re living on our new branch. 🎉

---

## 🧭 Step 2: Work Freely

Edit files, add features, break things, and fix them again — all without touching `main`.

Let’s say we update `index.html` to add a new bio section:

```html
<section id="bio">
  <h2>Meet the Developer</h2>
  <p>Professor Solo: lover of syntax, breaker of bugs.</p>
</section>
```

Then commit it:

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add bio section to homepage"
```

Now our branch has diverged from main — a safe space for creativity.

---

## 🪄 Step 3: Merge Back to Main

Once the branch is ready, we bring those changes home.

```bash
git switch main
git merge feature/add-bio
```

If no one else has changed the same lines, Git merges automatically — known as a **fast-forward** merge.

```
main ──●──●──●──●──●──●──▶
                 ↑
             merged branch
```

We can now safely delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -d feature/add-bio
```

Git keeps the history, even after the branch itself is gone.

---

## 💥 Step 4: Handling Merge Conflicts

Sometimes, two branches change the same file in different ways.  
That’s when Git taps us on the shoulder:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>Welcome to the Web Dev TnT Lab!</p>
=======
<p>Welcome to the Professor Solo Experience!</p>
>>>>>>> feature/add-bio
```

We fix the conflict manually — choose what stays, what goes, or even combine both — then:

```bash
git add index.html
git commit
```

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Merge conflicts aren’t failures — they’re conversations between timelines.

---

## 🌲 Step 5: Naming Branches Like a Pro

Good branch names make collaboration clear:

| Type        | Prefix     | Example                    |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| New feature | `feature/` | `feature/add-contact-form` |
| Bug fix     | `fix/`     | `fix/nav-hover-color`      |
| Hotfix      | `hotfix/`  | `hotfix/login-error`       |
| Docs        | `docs/`    | `docs/update-readme`       |
| Release     | `release/` | `release/2.0.0`            |

💡 Use **kebab-case** (all lowercase, hyphen-separated).  
Avoid spaces, punctuation, and emojis — no matter how tempting.

---

## 🧩 Step 6: See All Branches

List all local branches:

```bash
git branch
```

See remote branches too:

```bash
git branch -r
```

And view the branch graph with:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

This command shows all the project’s timelines at once — the Git multiverse.

---

## ✅ Mission Check: The Multiverse Awaits

We can now:

1. Create and switch branches (`git switch -c branch-name`)
2. Merge changes back into main (`git merge`)
3. Resolve conflicts gracefully
4. Follow naming conventions for clarity
5. Visualize and manage multiple timelines at once

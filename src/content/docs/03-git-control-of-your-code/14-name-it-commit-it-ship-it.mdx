# Name It, Commit It, Ship It

🎵 _“Stage it, commit it, push it, ship it.”_  
If Daft Punk had written version control, it would sound exactly like Git.

This page is all about naming things with purpose and committing with style — the rhythm that keeps every project dancing in sync.

## 🗂️ Repository Naming — Keep It Clean, Keep It Clear

Your repository’s name is its first impression.  
Let’s make it classy, descriptive, and easy to remember.

| Bad Example        | Good Example             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `Final_Project_V2` | `webdevtnt-html-forms`   |
| `stuff`            | `portfolio-site`         |
| `new-repo`         | `lesson-03-css-dynamite` |

**Rules of thumb:**

- Use **kebab‑case** (lowercase‑with‑hyphens)
- Start with context or purpose (`lesson‑`, `assignment‑`, `demo‑`)
- Avoid spaces, underscores, emojis, and mystery names
- Bonus: add your course tag (`webdevtnt`, `prof‑solo‑lab`, etc.)

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Your repo name should tell the world _what it is_, not _who made it._

## 🌿 Branch Naming — Order in the Codeverse

Branches are like side quests. Name them well and everyone knows their purpose.

| Prefix     | Purpose                 | Example                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `feature/` | New functionality       | `feature/add-contact-form` |
| `fix/`     | Bug fix                 | `fix/navbar-overlap`       |
| `hotfix/`  | Urgent production patch | `hotfix/typo-footer`       |
| `docs/`    | Documentation updates   | `docs/readme-formatting`   |
| `release/` | Pre‑release staging     | `release/2.0`              |

**Style Guide:**

- Always use **lowercase + hyphens**
- Keep it short and specific (`feature/dark‑mode`, not `feature/that‑one‑thing‑I‑forgot‑to‑do`)
- No spaces, no chaos

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Branch names are the signposts of teamwork — label them like directions, not riddles.

## ✍️ Commit Messages — Say What, Not How

Commit messages tell the story of your project one line at a time.  
A good one reads like a newspaper headline — clear, active, and concise.

**Format:**

```
type: short description

(optional longer explanation)
```

**Common Types:**
| Type | Meaning | Example |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat: add responsive nav bar` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix: correct padding on hero image` |
| `refactor` | Code restructure | `refactor: simplify grid logic` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs: update README install guide` |
| `style` | Non‑functional changes | `style: format CSS for readability` |
| `chore` | Maintenance | `chore: update dependencies` |

**Examples of Great Commits:**

```
feat: add accessible skip link for keyboard users
fix: correct footer background color on mobile
docs: clarify setup instructions for students
```

**Examples of Not‑So‑Great Commits:**

```
stuff
final update
fixed it again
why won't this work
```

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Use the **imperative mood** — “Add feature,” not “Added feature.”  
Git already knows who did it and when — your job is to explain _what_ and _why._

## 💥 The Technologic of Git

_(with apologies — and respect — to Daft Punk)_

```
Stage it, commit it,
Push it, ship it,
Pull it, merge it,
Fix it, check it,
Tag it, stash it,
Branch it, trash it,
Fetch it, log it,
Push it, ship it.
```

Every developer has their rhythm. Git just keeps the beat.

## ✅ Mission Check: Commit to the Groove

By now, we can:

1. Name repositories clearly and consistently
2. Create meaningful, readable branch names
3. Write strong, informative commit messages
4. Follow conventions that make collaboration smooth
5. Groove to the rhythm of add‑commit‑push‑repeat

💡 **Professor Solo says:**

> “Code has rhythm. Git is the beat.  
> Name it, commit it, ship it — and keep the groove clean.”

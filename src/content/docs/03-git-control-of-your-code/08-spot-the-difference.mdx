# Spot the Difference

You’ve been committing like a pro — now let’s learn how to **see** what changed.  
This is where we become Git detectives, tracing every line of code that moved, shifted, or vanished.

Git has a built-in highlighter for change. It’s called the **diff**.

---

## 🔍 What a Diff Really Is

A _diff_ is a comparison between two versions of your files — a way to visualize what changed between “then” and “now.”

Git uses simple symbols to show these changes:

| Symbol | Meaning                |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| `+`    | A line was **added**   |
| `-`    | A line was **removed** |
| none   | Line stayed the same   |

Example:

```
- color: red;
+ color: #ff0000;
```

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Git doesn’t judge — it just shows the truth. Every diff tells a story.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Compare Unstaged Changes

When we modify files but haven’t staged them yet, we can see what changed since the last commit:

```bash
git diff
```

This compares our **working directory** to the last committed version.

```
working dir  →  last commit
```

Output highlights every addition or deletion line by line.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Compare Staged Changes

Once we’ve staged changes with `git add`, those files move into the **staging area**.  
Now, to compare what’s staged (ready to be committed) against the last commit:

```bash
git diff --staged
```

```
staging area  →  last commit
```

This is your “double-check” moment before sealing the deal with a commit.

💡 **Professor Solo’s Pro Tip:**  
Think of `git diff` as “what I’m working on” and `git diff --staged` as “what I’m about to submit.”

---

## 🧭 Step 3: Compare Between Commits

Sometimes we need to see what changed between snapshots in history:

```bash
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
```

This compares the most recent commit (`HEAD`) to the one before it (`HEAD~1`).

Or compare by specific commit hashes:

```bash
git diff a1b2c3d e4f5g6h
```

💡 Use `git log --oneline` to find those commit hashes quickly.

---

## 🧠 Step 4: See Changes Inside a Commit

We can also inspect the details of a specific commit with:

```bash
git show <commit-hash>
```

This shows the commit message, author, date, and diff — everything that changed in that commit.

Example:

```
commit 1e9b312 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Professor Solo <solo@example.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 6 10:24 2025

    Add About Me section to homepage

diff --git a/index.html b/index.html
+ <section id="bio">
+   <h2>About Me</h2>
+ </section>
```

Git time-travel in one tidy command.

---

## 🧩 Step 5: Explore with git log -p

If we want to see the diff for each commit in history:

```bash
git log -p
```

That’s the “documentary mode” of our project — every change, frame by frame.

Press `q` to quit viewing when you’re done.

---

## ⚙️ Step 6: Diffing Branches

To see how two branches differ before merging:

```bash
git diff main feature/add-bio
```

This shows what would change if we merged `feature/add-bio` into `main`.

ASCII visualization:

```
main ──●──●──●──▶
          \
           └──●──●──▶ feature/add-bio
```

---

## 🧩 Step 7: The HEAD Compass

Remember, `HEAD` is your bookmark — it points to your current position in history.  
When you diff against `HEAD`, you’re comparing changes relative to where you are now.

```
Working Directory → Staging Area → HEAD (Last Commit)
```

Each diff command just asks Git: “Show me the gap between these two.”

---

## ✅ Mission Check: Detective Mode Activated

We can now:

1. Use `git diff` to inspect unstaged changes
2. Use `git diff --staged` before committing
3. Compare commits and branches directly
4. Use `git show` and `git log -p` to analyze commit details
5. Understand the diff flow from working directory → staging → HEAD

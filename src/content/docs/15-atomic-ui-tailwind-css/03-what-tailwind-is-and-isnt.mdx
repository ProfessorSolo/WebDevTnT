## Clearing the Air Early

Before we go any further, we need to reset expectations.

Tailwind tends to trigger strong reactions:
- “It’s just inline styles.”
- “It’s unreadable.”
- “It replaces CSS.”

None of those are accurate.

Let’s draw the boundaries clearly.

---

## What Tailwind *Is*

Tailwind is:

- a utility-first CSS framework
- a predefined design system
- a constraint engine
- a composition tool

It gives you **approved building blocks** for UI.

Nothing more.  
Nothing less.

---

## What Tailwind Is *Not*

Tailwind is not:

- inline styles  
- a component library  
- a replacement for understanding CSS  
- a magic bullet for bad design  

If you don’t understand layout, spacing, and flow, Tailwind won’t save you.

---

## Utilities ≠ Inline Styles

Inline styles:
- bypass the cascade
- can’t be reused
- don’t scale

Tailwind utilities:
- compile to real CSS
- participate in the cascade
- come from a shared system

They look similar.

They behave very differently.

---

## Tailwind Doesn’t Remove CSS

Tailwind changes **where CSS decisions live**.

Instead of:
- inventing names
- managing specificity
- maintaining large stylesheets

You:
- compose utilities
- follow a system
- keep decisions visible

CSS is still doing the work.

Tailwind just organizes the inputs.

---

## Opinionated on Purpose

Tailwind is opinionated about:
- spacing scales
- color usage
- typography
- responsiveness

Those opinions exist to:
- reduce entropy
- improve consistency
- speed teams up

You trade freedom for leverage.

---

## Why This Boundary Matters

Misunderstanding Tailwind leads to:
- misuse
- frustration
- unnecessary abstraction

Understanding its role makes it:
- predictable
- boring (in a good way)
- easy to reason about

---

## The Contract

Tailwind makes a deal with you:

> “Stay within the system, and UI becomes easier to scale.”

Break the system, and you’re back to fighting CSS.

## ⏭ From Boundaries to Building Blocks

Now that the edges are clear, we can look at what actually makes Tailwind powerful.

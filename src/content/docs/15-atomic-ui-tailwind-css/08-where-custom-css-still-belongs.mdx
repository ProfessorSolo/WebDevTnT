## Tailwind Isn’t a Religion

Tailwind is powerful.

But the goal is not:
> “Do everything with utilities.”

The goal is:
> “Ship consistent UI with minimal chaos.”

That sometimes means writing custom CSS.

---

## Use Tailwind for the Common Case

Tailwind is strongest when the UI is:

- layout and spacing heavy
- responsive
- component-oriented
- made of repeatable patterns

This is most UI.

That’s why Tailwind feels like a superpower.

---

## Write Custom CSS for the Rare Case

Custom CSS is often the better tool for:

- complex animations
- keyframes and timing systems
- highly bespoke one-off visuals
- advanced selectors
- non-trivial calculations
- browser quirks and fallbacks

For these, utilities can become noise.

---

## The “Escape Hatch” Pattern

A healthy Tailwind project typically includes:

- Tailwind utilities for composition
- a small custom stylesheet for specialized rules
- tokens / theme configuration where needed

The system stays coherent.

---

## When `@apply` Helps

`@apply` can be useful when:

- a pattern repeats widely
- the pattern has a clear name
- the abstraction stays stable

Use it as a tool of last resort, not a first reflex.

Compose first.

---

## When `@apply` Hurts

`@apply` becomes dangerous when it:

- hides decisions again
- creates “mystery classes”
- reintroduces override chains
- makes refactors risky

If your CSS starts to feel like it did before Tailwind, you’ve looped back.

---

## Component Libraries Are Not Cheating

Sometimes the right move is to use a component library that already solved the problem.

That’s not weakness.

That’s professional judgment.

Tailwind works well *with* component libraries.

---

## The Rule of Thumb

Use Tailwind to express:

- structure
- spacing
- layout
- state
- responsiveness

Use custom CSS to express:

- behavior that doesn’t map cleanly to tokens
- visuals that are truly bespoke
- animation systems

The goal is clarity.

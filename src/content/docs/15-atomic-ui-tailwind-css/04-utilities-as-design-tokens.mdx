## Design Decisions, Made Explicit

In traditional CSS, design decisions are often implicit.

- spacing values vary
- colors drift
- font sizes multiply
- “just this once” becomes routine

Over time, consistency erodes.

Atomic systems solve this by **making decisions explicit**.

---

## What a Design Token Is

A design token is a named decision:

- spacing unit
- color value
- font size
- border radius

Tokens are not styles.

They are **constraints**.

---

## Tailwind Utilities *Are* Tokens

In Tailwind:

- `p-4` is not “padding 1rem”
- `text-sm` is not “font-size 0.875rem”
- `bg-slate-800` is not “that dark gray we like”

They are *references* to a shared system.

You don’t pick values.

You pick from approved options.

---

## Why This Matters

When everyone uses the same tokens:

- spacing stays consistent
- colors don’t drift
- typography feels intentional
- UI looks cohesive by default

Consistency stops being a policing problem.

It becomes automatic.

---

## Fewer Decisions, Better Focus

Atomic UI removes hundreds of micro-decisions:

- “Is this 14px or 15px?”
- “Should this be #333 or #444?”
- “Is this margin slightly bigger?”

Those decisions were never where value was created.

Now they’re gone.

---

## Reading Tokens as Intent

Seeing this:

```html
<div class="p-6 bg-slate-800 text-white">
```

Tells you immediately:

- spacing is deliberate
- contrast is intentional
- hierarchy is clear

You don’t need to inspect a stylesheet.

The intent is visible.

---

## Tokens Scale Better Than Rules

Rules change meaning as systems grow.

Tokens don’t.

They’re reused.
They’re limited.
They’re predictable.

That’s why atomic systems age better.

---

## 🧪 MiniMo — Token-Driven Consistency

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/15-atomic-ui-tailwind-css/04-design-tokens-minimo.html"
  title="Utilities as Design Tokens"
  height="720px"
/>

Change the spacing token.  
Watch the UI update everywhere.

That’s leverage.

## ⏭ Composition Is Next

Once decisions are encoded as tokens, the real power comes from **combining them**.

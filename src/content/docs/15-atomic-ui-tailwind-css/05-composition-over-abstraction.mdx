## The Instinct to Abstract

When developers see repetition, they instinctively reach for abstraction.

In CSS, that usually means:

- creating new class names
- extracting shared rules
- building layers of indirection

This feels tidy.

At scale, it often isn’t.

---

## Abstractions Drift

CSS abstractions tend to age poorly:

- their original intent fades
- edge cases pile up
- overrides appear
- names stop matching behavior

Eventually, developers are afraid to touch them.

The abstraction becomes a liability.

---

## Composition Keeps Intent Local

Atomic UI favors **composition** instead.

You assemble UI at the point of use:

- spacing
- layout
- color
- state

Everything that matters is visible where it’s applied.

There’s no guessing what a class does.

---

## HTML as the Source of Truth

With composition:

- HTML expresses layout
- classes express intent
- CSS stays predictable

You don’t have to jump between files to understand UI.

That dramatically improves maintainability.

---

## Fewer Layers, Fewer Surprises

Composition avoids:

- deep inheritance chains
- magical overrides
- specificity battles

Each utility does one thing.

Together, they describe the interface.

---

## When Abstraction _Does_ Make Sense

This is not an absolutist rule.

Abstraction is still useful for:

- repeated animations
- complex interactions
- shared component behavior
- non-visual logic

The key is **intentional abstraction**, not reflexive abstraction.

---

## The `@apply` Trap

Tailwind allows `@apply`.

That doesn’t mean you should reach for it immediately.

Overusing `@apply`:

- recreates traditional CSS problems
- hides decisions again
- increases coupling

Compose first.
Abstract later — if needed.

## 🧪 MiniMo — Compose vs Abstract

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/15-atomic-ui-tailwind-css/05-composition-vs-abstraction-minimo.html"
  title="Composition vs Abstraction"
  height="720px"
/>

Compare a utility-composed UI to an abstracted version.

Notice:

- readability
- flexibility
- ease of change

## ⏭ Scaling Without Layers

Once composition feels natural, the next question is how it adapts across screens and states.

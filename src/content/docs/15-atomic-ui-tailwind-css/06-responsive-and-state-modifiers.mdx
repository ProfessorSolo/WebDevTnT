## One System, Many Conditions

In traditional CSS, responsiveness and state add complexity fast:

- media queries multiply
- selectors grow longer
- overrides pile up

Atomic UI approaches this differently.

Conditions become **modifiers**, not new rules.

---

## Responsive Modifiers

Tailwind encodes breakpoints directly into class names:

- `sm:`
- `md:`
- `lg:`
- `xl:`

Instead of asking:
> “Where is the media query for this?”

You can ask:
> “Under what condition does this apply?”

---

## Reading Responsiveness Inline

Seeing this:

```html
<div class="p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8">
```

Tells you immediately:

- base padding is `p-4`
- increases at medium screens
- increases again at large screens

No stylesheet spelunking required.

---

## State Modifiers

Tailwind uses the same idea for interaction states:

- `hover:`
- `focus:`
- `active:`
- `disabled:`

States don’t live in separate rule blocks.

They live **next to the base style**.

---

## Visibility of Intent

Compare:

- “somewhere there’s a hover rule”

vs

```html
<button class="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 focus:ring-2">
```

The second one is explicit.

Intent is visible at the point of use.

---

## Combining Conditions

Modifiers stack cleanly:

```html
<button class="p-4 md:p-6 hover:bg-slate-200">
```

No special syntax.
No new CSS.
No specificity surprises.

---

## Why This Scales

This model:

- avoids override chains
- keeps related decisions together
- reduces cognitive load

You change behavior by editing markup, not hunting rules.

## 🧪 MiniMo — Responsive + State in One Place

<MiniMo
  src="/demos/15-atomic-ui-tailwind-css/06-responsive-state-modifiers-minimo.html"
  title="Responsive and State Modifiers"
  height="760px"
/>

Resize the viewport.  
Hover the elements.  
Notice how all behavior is declared inline.

## ⏭ Reading UI as Code

Once responsiveness and state live in the markup, something interesting happens.

You can understand UI **without running it**.

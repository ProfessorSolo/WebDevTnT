## CSS Isn’t the Problem

CSS is powerful.

It can:
- express layout
- define visual systems
- adapt responsively
- animate interfaces

The issue isn’t capability.

The issue is **scale**.

---

## Small Projects Hide the Cracks

On small projects:
- one developer writes most of the CSS
- styles live in a few files
- naming feels manageable
- everything is still fresh in memory

This creates a false sense of safety.

---

## Entropy Sets In

As projects grow:

- styles accumulate
- patterns drift
- rules overlap
- intent becomes unclear

CSS doesn’t rot —  
**systems rot**.

---

## Naming Becomes a Burden

Traditional CSS relies heavily on naming:

- class names
- component names
- modifier names
- utility names you invent yourself

Over time, teams ask:
- “Is there already a class for this?”
- “Can I reuse this safely?”
- “What will this break?”

Progress slows.

---

## Specificity Creeps Up

When styles conflict, developers respond by:

- adding more selectors
- increasing specificity
- reaching for `!important`

Each fix works locally.

Each fix makes the system harder to reason about globally.

---

## Global Scope, Global Risk

CSS is global by default.

That means:
- small changes can have wide effects
- refactors feel dangerous
- teams become hesitant to clean things up

Fear replaces confidence.

---

## The Core Issue

Traditional CSS assumes:

- developers remember existing styles
- naming stays consistent
- everyone follows the same mental model

That assumption doesn’t hold at scale.

---

## The Question Teams Started Asking

Not:
> “How do we write more CSS?”

But:
> “How do we stop fighting our own styles?”

That question leads directly to atomic approaches.

## ⏭ From Symptoms to Strategy

Before introducing new tools, we need a different way of *thinking* about UI.

## This Is About Reasoning, Not Memorization

You are not expected to remember utility names.

You *are* expected to reason about:
- structure
- spacing
- hierarchy
- responsiveness
- state

Atomic UI rewards understanding, not recall.

## Your Starter Snippet

Copy/paste this into **Tailwind Play**:
https://play.tailwindcss.com

Your job is to **read it**, **predict it**, then **improve it** — without writing custom CSS.

```html
<main class="min-h-screen bg-slate-950 text-slate-100 p-6">
  <section class="max-w-md mx-auto border border-slate-800 bg-slate-900/40 rounded-xl p-4 space-y-3">
    <header class="space-y-1">
      <h1 class="text-lg font-semibold">Project Status</h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-slate-300">A tiny UI you will improve using tokens, modifiers, and composition.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="flex items-center justify-between gap-3">
      <span class="text-sm text-slate-200">Build</span>
      <span class="text-xs bg-slate-800 rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-slate-200">Passing</span>
    </div>

    <div class="flex items-center justify-between gap-3">
      <span class="text-sm text-slate-200">Deploy</span>
      <span class="text-xs bg-slate-800 rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-slate-200">Pending</span>
    </div>

    <button class="w-full rounded-lg border border-sky-500/40 bg-sky-500/15 px-4 py-3 text-sm font-semibold
                   hover:bg-sky-500/25 hover:border-sky-500/70
                   focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-4 focus-visible:ring-sky-500 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-slate-950">
      View details
    </button>
  </section>
</main>
```

## Step 1: Read Before You Run

Before rendering, answer:

- What is the layout?
- Where is spacing applied?
- What tokens are being used (spacing, color, radius, typography)?
- What states are defined?

Write your prediction in 3–5 sentences.

---

## Step 2: Improve It Without Rewriting

Make **three upgrades**:

### Upgrade A — Spacing Rhythm
Goal: make it feel more intentional.

- increase the vertical rhythm in the card
- increase spacing between header + rows
- avoid random one-off values

Hint: you’re changing *spacing tokens*, not “CSS”.

### Upgrade B — Hierarchy
Goal: improve scanability.

- make the title feel more “title”
- make the description feel more secondary
- make row labels and badges distinct

Hint: change *typography tokens* and *contrast tokens*.

### Upgrade C — Responsiveness
Goal: make it scale gracefully.

- keep it readable on small screens
- at `md:` widen the card and increase padding
- at `md:` consider a two-column layout for the rows (optional)

Hint: modifiers should sit inline next to base utilities.

---

## Step 3: Spot the Token

For each upgrade, document:

- **what token you changed**
- **why it was the right level of change**
- **what else it affected**

Bullet points are fine.

---

## Step 4: Know When to Stop

If you feel the urge to:
- extract classes
- reach for `@apply`
- write custom CSS

Pause and ask:

> “Is this a real pattern, or just discomfort?”

Only abstract when it’s a **repeatable pattern**.

---

## Self-Check Rubric

You’re done when:

- [ ] You can explain the layout just by reading the classnames
- [ ] You made spacing more consistent without custom CSS
- [ ] You improved hierarchy using tokens
- [ ] You added at least one responsive modifier (`md:`)
- [ ] Your button has clear hover + focus-visible states
- [ ] You can name at least 3 tokens you changed and why

---

## What You Should Walk Away With

- Less fear of “messy” markup  
- More confidence editing UI in place  
- Clearer understanding of how atomic systems scale  

That’s progress.

# Git Quick or Git Gone (Cheatsheet)

Fast, friendly, and Professor‑approved.  
Each command comes with a one‑liner so we remember **what** it does at a glance.

> 💡 Tip: When in doubt, run `git status`. It’s Git’s way of narrating the moment.

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Identity

```bash
git --version
# Verify Git is installed and reachable on PATH

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
# Set your display name for all commits on this machine

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
# Set your email (shows on GitHub commit history)

git config --global init.defaultBranch main
# Make 'main' the default branch for new repos

git config --global color.ui auto
# Enable helpful colored output in the terminal
```

---

## 🏁 Start a Repo (or Clone One)

```bash
git init
# Create a new, empty repository in the current folder

git clone <url>
# Copy a remote repository (files + full history)
```

---

## 📝 Stage & Commit

```bash
git status
# Show what's changed, what's staged, and what's next

git add <file>
# Stage one file for the next commit

git add .
# Stage all new/modified files (respecting .gitignore)

git restore --staged <file>
# Unstage a file (keep your edits)

git commit -m "Message"
# Save staged changes as a new snapshot with a message
```

---

## 🔍 Inspect Changes & History

```bash
git diff
# See unstaged changes since the last commit

git diff --staged
# See staged changes that will go into the next commit

git log --oneline --graph --decorate
# Compact, visual commit history (branch pointers included)

git show <hash>
# Display a single commit (message + diff)
```

---

## 🌿 Branching

```bash
git branch
# List local branches

git switch -c feature/new-thing
# Create and switch to a new branch

git switch main
# Move back to main

git branch -d feature/new-thing
# Delete a fully merged branch (local)
```

---

## 🔀 Merging & Rebase (light touch)

```bash
git merge <branch>
# Bring the named branch into your current branch

git pull --rebase
# Update your branch by replaying your commits on top (clean history)
```

> ⚠️ Rebase rewrites history; it’s great locally, risky on shared branches.

---

## 🧹 Undo & Rescue

```bash
git restore <file>
# Discard local changes in a file (revert to last commit)

git reset --hard HEAD
# Reset all files to the last commit (destructive for uncommitted work)

git commit --amend
# Edit the last commit (message and/or staged content)

git stash -m "WIP"
# Temporarily shelve uncommitted work

git stash list
# See your stashes (like a clipboard history)

git stash apply stash@{0}
# Reapply a specific stash (keeps it in the list)

git reflog
# Show every move of HEAD (ultimate “oops” recovery ledger)
```

---

## 🌐 Remotes & Sync

```bash
git remote -v
# List remotes and their URLs

git remote add origin <url>
# Link the local repo to a remote named 'origin'

git push -u origin main
# Push commits and set upstream tracking for 'main'

git push
# Send local commits to the tracked remote branch

git pull
# Fetch + merge updates from the tracked remote branch

git fetch
# Download updates without merging (preview what's new)
```

---

## 🏷️ Tags & Releases

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First stable release"
# Create an annotated tag for a version checkpoint

git push origin v1.0.0
# Push a single tag to the remote

git push origin --tags
# Push all local tags to the remote
```

---

## 🤝 PR Flow (CLI side of the dance)

```bash
git push origin feature/amazing-idea
# Publish your branch to GitHub (open PR on the site)

# After merge:
git branch -d feature/amazing-idea
# Clean up local

git push origin --delete feature/amazing-idea
# Clean up remote
```

---

## 🧰 Helpful Aliases (speed boosters)

```bash
git config --global alias.st status
# Use 'git st' instead of 'git status'

git config --global alias.lg "log --oneline --graph --decorate --all"
# Pretty, compact history view: 'git lg'
```

---

## 🧠 Mental Models (sticky notes for the brain)

- **Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository** — edit, select, snapshot.
- **Commit small & often** — tell one story per message.
- **Branches are timelines** — create them freely, merge with care.
- **`git status` is the truth** — ask it before you guess.
- **`reflog` is your parachute** — mistakes are fixable.

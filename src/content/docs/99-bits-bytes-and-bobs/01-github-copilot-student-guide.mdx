## 🧠 Step 4: Use Copilot Effectively

Try these prompts right in your editor:

```html
<!-- HTML Example -->
<!-- Type: -->
<form>
  <!-- Then pause... Copilot will suggest input fields -->
</form>
```

```css
/* CSS Example */
/* Type: */
.container {
  display: ;
}
/* Copilot often suggests `flex` or `grid` */
```

```js
// JS Example
// Type:
function validateEmail(email) {
  // Copilot will propose a regex validation
}
```

💡 **Tip:**

- Press **Tab** to accept a suggestion.
- Press **Ctrl + ]** / **Cmd + ]** to see alternative completions.
- Use `Ctrl + Enter` (`Cmd + Enter` on Mac) to open the full Copilot panel.

## 🧾 FAQ: Do I Need to Use My School Email for GitHub?

> **No.** Your GitHub account can use _any_ email address (personal or school).  
> During verification for the **GitHub Student Developer Pack**, you’ll just need to prove your student status using your **school email** or upload supporting documentation.  
> Once approved, all Education benefits (including Copilot) are linked to your GitHub account — not to your email domain.

## 🔍 Step 5: Responsible Use

✅ Great for:

- Speeding up boilerplate code
- Exploring syntax or patterns
- Learning idiomatic examples

🚫 Not for:

- Copying entire assignments
- Submitting AI-written work as your own

Think of it as a **pair-programming assistant**, not an autopilot.

# 💾 Bits, Bytes, and Bobs

Welcome to **Bits, Bytes, and Bobs** — the corner of the WebDevTnT site where all the small-but-mighty stuff lives.

Here you'll find a growing collection of:

- **Course-level resources** — setup guides, study references, and workflow helpers
- **Tips & tricks** — shortcuts, fixes, and insider moves from the WebDevTnT lab
- **Guides & deep dives** — occasional write-ups that expand on class demos or common pain points

Everything here is designed to **support your learning** — from the obscure tips and tricks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to advanced dev tools like **GitHub Copilot** and **AI-assisted coding**.

> Think of this section as your digital lab bench: where experiments, discoveries, and “aha!” moments get documented for future cohorts.

_“p.s. Bob's your guide!”_
